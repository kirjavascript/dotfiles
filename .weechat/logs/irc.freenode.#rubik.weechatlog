2018-09-18 23:28:29	+venim	i guess its weird for me to think about a repo with 10 different random scripts
2018-09-18 23:28:40	+venim	and how to branch changes or w/e
2018-09-18 23:28:58	+j`ey	if its just for small scripts you wont need branches
2018-09-18 23:29:09	+venim	i guess if i want to try and mess with one file, i can make a branch just for that file
2018-09-18 23:29:24	+venim	and merge it back

2018-09-18 23:36:25	+venim	git revert doesn't seem to work with a single file
2018-09-18 23:36:44	+venim	it looks like you can reset a particular file though
2018-09-18 23:37:51	+j`ey	well i assumed you were making a commit for a single file
2018-09-18 23:38:29	+j`ey	you can also do: git show SHA1:./path/to/file
2018-09-18 23:38:52	+venim	the commit would only have the change for one file
2018-09-18 23:39:04	+venim	but another commit might have a change for a unrelated file
2018-09-18 23:39:12	+j`ey	yes
2018-09-18 23:39:23	+j`ey	but git revert SHA1 will only affect the file that was commit in SHA1
2018-09-18 23:39:43	+venim	will it? or will it revert the entire repo to the state it was in at SHA1?
2018-09-18 23:39:56	+j`ey	it will
2018-09-18 23:40:07	+j`ey	it takes what you did with 'git commit'
2018-09-18 23:40:09	+j`ey	and undoes it
2018-09-18 23:40:11	+venim	ya which means the file that was changed in SHA2 will revert also
2018-09-18 23:40:12	+j`ey	as another commit
2018-09-18 23:40:24	+venim	commit 1 changed foo.txt
2018-09-18 23:40:28	+venim	commit 2 changed bar.txt
2018-09-18 23:40:34	+venim	commit 3 changed foo.txt
2018-09-18 23:40:40	+venim	i want to get foo back to the state in commit 1
2018-09-18 23:40:41	+venim	how do
2018-09-18 23:40:47	+j`ey	git revert 3
2018-09-18 23:40:49	+venim	without bar being affected
2018-09-18 23:41:13	+j`ey	git revert 3 applies a new commit that undoes git commit 3
2018-09-18 23:41:40	+venim	i think i just need to use reset
2018-09-18 23:42:13	+j`ey	ok venim 
2018-09-18 23:42:17	+j`ey	you know more than me >_>
2018-09-18 23:42:34	+venim	except what you're saying goes against what i'm finding
2018-09-18 23:42:55	+j`ey	you want to undo commit 3 right?
2018-09-18 23:43:02	+venim	what if i had a commit 4 that changed another one
2018-09-18 23:43:09	+Kirjava	the files in venim's repo are all named like
2018-09-18 23:43:11	+venim	another file
2018-09-18 23:43:11	+j`ey	then you want to 'git revert 3'

2018-09-18 23:43:33	+j`ey	Kirjava: lol
2018-09-18 23:43:37	+Kirjava	demo_backup.py
2018-09-18 23:43:51	+venim	oh revert only undoes the changes within the commit?
2018-09-18 23:43:55	+j`ey	git revert creates a new commit that is the exact opposite of the commit you give it
2018-09-18 23:44:00	+venim	not reverts the entire repo?
2018-09-18 23:44:00	+j`ey	23:41:44 <+j`ey> git revert 3 applies a new commit that undoes git commit 3
2018-09-18 23:44:25	+venim	so as long as the commit only effects the single file that would work?
2018-09-18 23:44:33	+j`ey	correct
2018-09-18 23:44:40	+j`ey	git reset is more like resetting the whole repo
2018-09-18 23:45:29	+j`ey	hard to say what your use case is
2018-09-18 23:45:48	+j`ey	you can also do git show SHA1:./path/to/file which shows the file at that commit
2018-09-18 23:46:14	+venim	my idea is that instead of commenting out a code block
2018-09-18 23:46:21	+venim	i can just commit the file, delete it and move on
2018-09-18 23:46:32	+venim	knowing i can go back if i want to
2018-09-18 23:46:37	+j`ey	ye
2018-09-18 23:46:43	+j`ey	that's git 4 u
2018-09-18 23:46:49	+venim	but i might be changing other files in other commits before i want to go back
2018-09-18 23:46:51	+Kirjava	DONT COMMIT COMMENTED OUT CODE

2018-09-19 00:01:39	+j`ey	well.. that's a bit weird because that's the commit that made the file
2018-09-19 00:02:14	+j`ey	i mean first was the commit that created that file
2018-09-19 00:02:20	+venim	well sure
2018-09-19 00:02:24	+venim	so add a third
2018-09-19 00:02:28	+venim	and then revert to the second
2018-09-19 00:02:30	+venim	still doesn't work
2018-09-19 00:02:34	+j`ey	what doesnt work about it?
2018-09-19 00:02:58	+venim	it gives me an error
2018-09-19 00:03:06	+j`ey	>_>
2018-09-19 00:03:07	+j`ey	what error
2018-09-19 00:04:15	+venim	venim@vps:/home/venim/gittest$ git revert 34317ce3711f4cc3328e4cbafa25b973df315ddd
2018-09-19 00:04:18	+venim	error: could not revert 34317ce... second
2018-09-19 00:04:20	+venim	hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths

2018-09-19 00:05:24	+j`ey	but this is also a different situation than you were talking about
2018-09-19 00:05:37	+j`ey	you wanted to get back to a particular file
2018-09-19 00:05:47	+j`ey	but now youve added more stuff to the file in a 3rd commit
2018-09-19 00:06:01	+j`ey	you said: 1 edit foo.txt 2 edit bar.txt 3 edit foo.txt
2018-09-19 00:06:16	+j`ey	but now you have: 1 edit foo.txt 2 edit foo.txt 3 edit foo.txt
2018-09-19 00:06:52	+venim	figure out the issue?
2018-09-19 00:06:54	+venim	I had to swap to my phone 
2018-09-19 00:06:58	+venim	train arrived 
2018-09-19 00:07:37	+j`ey	lol
2018-09-19 00:07:42	+j`ey	so you didnt see what I said?
2018-09-19 00:07:51	+venim	nope
2018-09-19 00:07:58	+j`ey	lol
2018-09-19 00:08:00	+venim	I'll check in 15 min then 
2018-09-19 00:08:05	+j`ey	00:05:56 <+j`ey> but this is also a different situation than you were talking about
2018-09-19 00:08:07	+j`ey	00:06:09 <+j`ey> you wanted to get back to a particular file
2018-09-19 00:08:10	+j`ey	00:06:18 <+j`ey> but now youve added more stuff to the file in a 3rd commit

2018-09-19 00:08:58	+j`ey	yes
2018-09-19 00:09:01	+venim	I'll try it when I get home 
2018-09-19 00:09:19	+venim	but if that's all I need then cool 
2018-09-19 00:09:58	+venim	it just seemed silly to have a separate repo just to version control random scripts 
2018-09-19 00:10:29	+j`ey	you mean a separate repo per script?
2018-09-19 00:10:38	+venim	yes
2018-09-19 00:11:23	+venim	I'm getting a new computer set up and I'm trying to make my programming workflow more "professional"
2018-09-19 00:11:37	+venim	idk how to organize all the crap I do 
2018-09-19 00:12:09	+j`ey	hard to say, I dont think it's overkillt o have several repos
2018-09-19 00:12:19	+j`ey	depends how similar the scripts are
2018-09-19 00:12:23	+venim	I can't decide how to use vs code workspaces too
2018-09-19 00:12:24	+j`ey	if there's any logical groups
2018-09-19 00:12:26	xoxo	anyone have an algorithm to match a cube with another one ?
2018-09-19 00:12:33	xoxo	(if they are both jumbled)
2018-09-19 00:12:48	+j`ey	go via solved :P
2018-09-19 00:12:57	+venim	ya I'm not trying to do it all in one repo, but it seems weird to have a repo for only a single file
2018-09-19 00:13:07	+j`ey	not at all!
2018-09-19 00:13:49	+j`ey	im off to bed

2018-09-19 00:44:08	+venim	gotta use reset and then checkout the old file
2018-09-19 00:51:12	xoxo	as ar as i can tell, if i give ksolve a cube status it can solve it ?
2018-09-19 00:51:15	xoxo	far*
2018-09-19 00:52:23	+venim	you should be able to define "solved"

2018-09-19 10:39:16	@trueNibblr	Fixed by going to bathroom and wanking off, or flipping around between the pants and stomach.
2018-09-19 10:39:34	izabera	i wrote a thingy that dumps core, and the coredump won't have any memory in it
2018-09-19 10:39:47	Seb_Weyer	you get a boner when you're tired, because then you relax and blood flows into your dick
2018-09-19 10:40:23	+Kirjava	yep
2018-09-19 10:40:24	izabera	like, it doesn't do this by using coredump_filter or prctl
2018-09-19 10:40:35	izabera	it literally creates a process with 0 maps
2018-09-19 10:40:44	+Kirjava	Seb_Weyer: yeah I googled it after it happening all the time
2018-09-19 10:40:47	izabera	which crashes immediately and dumps core
2018-09-19 10:40:50	+Kirjava	it's your body telling you to slep
2018-09-19 10:41:36	izabera	can you do that in rust?  NOOO???  lame language
2018-09-19 10:41:59	+j`ey	did you write it in python
2018-09-19 10:42:05	izabera	no
2018-09-19 10:42:40	izabera	it's actually pure c
2018-09-19 10:42:48	izabera	kinda cheating tho

2018-09-19 10:44:35	+Kirjava	I don't think the metrics your're using to rank languages are sound
2018-09-19 10:45:19	+j`ey	izabera: also i know nothing about coredump/maps etc
2018-09-19 10:45:46	+j`ey	izabera: why do you need to do the 'jit' part?
2018-09-19 10:45:59	+Kirjava	C is lame because it has no fungespace
2018-09-19 10:46:23	izabera	i need to move code and data to a map that's not backed by any file
2018-09-19 10:46:53	izabera	actually...
2018-09-19 10:47:23	izabera	i needed that because i was trying with wipeonfork
2018-09-19 10:47:35	izabera	which can't be used on file maps
2018-09-19 10:47:47	izabera	but dontfork should be ok
2018-09-19 10:48:12	izabera	yeah maybe you can just mark everything dontfork and it'll work
2018-09-19 10:48:15	izabera	let me try
2018-09-19 10:48:55	+Kirjava	RIIR
2018-09-19 10:49:40	izabera	heh it's working
2018-09-19 10:49:42	izabera	ok
2018-09-19 10:49:45	izabera	it's not as fun tho
2018-09-19 10:50:14	izabera	https://arin.ga/D6CbqL/raw
2018-09-19 10:50:24	+j`ey	lol nice
2018-09-19 10:53:06	+j`ey	'Each row in /proc/$PID/maps describes a region of contiguous virtual memory in a process or thread'
2018-09-19 10:53:58	+j`ey	'Do not make the pages in this range available to the child
2018-09-19 10:53:58	+j`ey	              after a fork(2).'
2018-09-19 10:54:06	+j`ey	(That's for DONTFORK)
2018-09-19 10:55:07	izabera	on the plus side, i can change my original code to wipeonfork, now that i've done the hard part
2018-09-19 10:56:21	+j`ey	when I was writing a bootloader for ARM I had to do that 'JIT' style thing too
2018-09-19 10:56:30	+j`ey	since it couldn't write to flash and read from it at the same time
2018-09-19 11:15:57	+Kirjava	so fucking tired
2018-09-19 11:16:07	izabera	j`ey: maybe you should have used a grown up language instead of rust
2018-09-19 11:17:30	+Kirjava	like javascript
2018-09-19 11:17:46	izabera	like sed
2018-09-19 11:18:03	izabera	do you guys want to see my brainfuck interpreter written in sed?
2018-09-19 11:18:13	+Kirjava	> guys
2018-09-19 11:18:18	+j`ey	i didnt know that if i wrote it in C, ARM could execute and write from/to flash at the same time
2018-09-19 11:18:35	izabera	yeah you better learn that

2018-09-19 11:21:13	izabera	why would i do that

2018-09-19 11:37:50	izabera	i have a half written x86 decoder

2018-09-19 11:38:23	izabera	actually at the moment it's almost done

2018-09-19 11:39:02	@trueNibblr	Hello World!
2018-09-19 11:40:30	+venim	oh maybe revert is working...
2018-09-19 11:41:13	+Kirjava	~bf --[----->+<]>-.++..
2018-09-19 11:41:14	@trueNibblr	egg
2018-09-19 11:42:58	+j`ey	venim: so does it work or?
2018-09-19 11:43:05	+venim	sometimes
2018-09-19 11:43:18	+venim	you can't revert a file creation commit 
2018-09-19 11:43:23	+venim	and you can't revert a commit twice
2018-09-19 11:43:31	+venim	but you shouldn't be doing that anyway
2018-09-19 11:43:37	+venim	so maybe
2018-09-19 11:44:26	+j`ey	right, I told you that you cant revert a file creation commit
2018-09-19 11:51:26	+j`ey	reverting a commit twice.. doesnt make sense
2018-09-19 11:52:23	+venim	no it doesn't
2018-09-19 11:53:53	+venim	i guess file level reset is pretty similar to revert
2018-09-19 11:54:22	+Kirjava	why cant you just use git normally
2018-09-19 11:54:31	+Kirjava	why are you using it (first time use) and just doing it wrong
2018-09-19 11:54:58	+Kirjava	why aren't you just using multiple repos
2018-09-19 11:55:02	+Kirjava	until you understand basic things
2018-09-19 11:55:08	+Kirjava	like reverting changes
2018-09-19 11:55:10	+Kirjava	MAKING COMMITS
2018-09-19 11:56:37	izabera	BREEDING COMMITS
2018-09-19 11:57:27	+Kirjava	it's like you installed vim but never leave insert mode
2018-09-19 11:58:18	izabera	works ok in gvim
2018-09-19 11:58:21	+j`ey	venim: what kinda 'reset'?
2018-09-19 11:58:40	+j`ey	venim: reset can do similar stuff to revert
2018-09-19 11:58:54	+venim	ya 
2018-09-19 11:58:55	+j`ey	you can reset stuff that you 'git added'
2018-09-19 11:59:08	+Kirjava	izabera: works ok with vim -y
2018-09-19 11:59:11	+j`ey	you can git reset to a particular commit (and lose all commits after that)
2018-09-19 11:59:24	+Kirjava	but what's the point ._.
2018-09-19 11:59:25	+venim	not with file based reset
2018-09-19 11:59:37	+venim	file based reset is essentially revert it seems
2018-09-19 11:59:40	+venim	since there is no file based revert
2018-09-19 11:59:56	+venim	git reset <hash> 1
2018-09-19 11:59:58	+venim	git checkout -- 1
2018-09-19 12:00:08	+venim	git commit -m 'reset file 1 to <hash>'
2018-09-19 12:00:19	+venim	or you can modify it before committing again
2018-09-19 12:00:28	+j`ey	or git show hash:./file
2018-09-19 12:00:49	+venim	ya and then manually do the change 
2018-09-19 12:00:51	+venim	sure
2018-09-19 12:01:32	+Kirjava	> manually do the change
2018-09-19 12:02:01	+Kirjava	"I want the productivity tool to make my life harder, not easier"
2018-09-19 12:02:02	+j`ey	venim: I just dont see why this part ios such an issue for you tbh
2018-09-19 12:02:09	+venim	idk either
2018-09-19 12:02:15	+j`ey	Istill dont see this as something you will do that often
2018-09-19 12:02:15	+venim	tbh i have no clue how to even use git the "right" way
2018-09-19 12:02:22	+venim	presumably not
2018-09-19 12:02:33	+j`ey	so I just dont see why youve latched onto it!
2018-09-19 12:02:36	+venim	idk
2018-09-19 12:02:45	+venim	it just seems like the way to revert changes of a file
2018-09-19 12:04:07	+venim	https://i.imgur.com/sOng0T2.png
2018-09-19 12:04:14	+venim	thats my "misc scripts" folder
2018-09-19 12:04:27	+j`ey	nice
2018-09-19 12:04:30	+j`ey	just as Kirjava expected
2018-09-19 12:04:31	+venim	i want source control for all of those random shits
2018-09-19 12:04:39	+Kirjava	lmao
2018-09-19 12:04:55	+venim	without the wave files its just a bunch of 3kb things
2018-09-19 12:04:59	+Kirjava	-old1
2018-09-19 12:06:42	+venim	so j`ey, how to manage versioning for just the .py files
2018-09-19 12:07:31	+j`ey	git add file.py
2018-09-19 12:07:35	+j`ey	instead of add .
2018-09-19 12:07:39	+venim	duh
2018-09-19 12:07:44	+venim	i get the concept of adding and committing 
2018-09-19 12:07:48	+j`ey	..
2018-09-19 12:07:52	+venim	but i'm working on ess
2018-09-19 12:07:59	+venim	make a few commits
2018-09-19 12:08:06	+venim	put that down and go to updateP for a few commits
2018-09-19 12:08:23	+venim	but then i realize half the shit on ess was wrong and i want to go back
2018-09-19 12:08:32	+venim	it seems reset/revert is the way you do that, no?
2018-09-19 12:08:38	+j`ey	yeah that's a way
2018-09-19 12:08:46	+venim	how am i supposed to do it then
2018-09-19 12:08:57	+j`ey	git reset/revert
2018-09-19 12:09:08	+venim	so i was right to think i needed to know hwo to do that
2018-09-19 12:09:29	+j`ey	or you could git show and see what changes you made
2018-09-19 12:09:40	+j`ey	or git log
2018-09-19 12:09:55	+venim	and copy/paste code blocks and shit?
2018-09-19 12:10:03	+j`ey	yeah
2018-09-19 12:10:28	+j`ey	I would probably just revert it
2018-09-19 12:10:30	+venim	sure if i wanted to only revert part of it
2018-09-19 12:11:07	+j`ey	still, git revert isnt used that often.. unless you develop in a weird way
2018-09-19 12:11:28	+venim	ya because its not doing what reset -> checkout -> commit does
2018-09-19 12:11:48	+j`ey	doing that is wierd too ^
2018-09-19 12:11:49	+venim	revert isn't loading the version of the file from that previous commit, its trying to undo the changes right
2018-09-19 12:12:02	+venim	thats all i'm essentially wanting to do
2018-09-19 12:12:05	+j`ey	correct
2018-09-19 12:12:16	+j`ey	but.. if you changed one file in that commit.. it's the same thing
2018-09-19 12:12:34	+venim	i guess
2018-09-19 12:13:04	+venim	nope
2018-09-19 12:13:17	+j`ey	how is it not the same?
2018-09-19 12:13:18	+venim	i think i know what breaks it
2018-09-19 12:13:23	+venim	line 1 > commit 1
2018-09-19 12:13:25	+venim	line 2> commit 2
2018-09-19 12:13:27	+venim	line 3 > commit 3
2018-09-19 12:13:35	+venim	revert 2 doesn't work
2018-09-19 12:13:44	+venim	since it doesn't know what to do with the line 3 commit stuff
2018-09-19 12:13:48	+j`ey	right..
2018-09-19 12:13:53	+j`ey	you'd need to revert 3 and revert 2
2018-09-19 12:14:02	+venim	which is why you can just reset 2
2018-09-19 12:14:07	+j`ey	yep
2018-09-19 12:14:12	+venim	replace the file with the version from that commit
2018-09-19 12:14:17	+venim	and the recommit it moving forward
2018-09-19 12:14:36	+venim	reverting a file should just work that way in one step...
2018-09-19 12:14:41	+venim	but it isn't built into git
2018-09-19 12:14:53	+j`ey	well it is.. since reset does that
2018-09-19 12:14:58	+j`ey	or git show ./path
2018-09-19 12:15:05	+venim	ya but you need 3 commands for it
2018-09-19 12:15:09	+j`ey	but revert isn't about 'files'
2018-09-19 12:15:11	+venim	rather than just a file-based revert
2018-09-19 12:15:12	+venim	exactly 
2018-09-19 12:15:26	+j`ey	because it's not a thing that people need often
2018-09-19 12:15:38	+venim	i don't plan on using it often either
2018-09-19 12:15:40	+j`ey	also if you put a script called 'git-file-revert' in your path
2018-09-19 12:15:47	+j`ey	you can use git file-revert blah
2018-09-19 12:15:50	+venim	true
2018-09-19 12:15:57	+j`ey	that's why im confused that we're still talking about it
2018-09-19 12:16:00	+venim	idfk
2018-09-19 12:16:03	+j`ey	it's a rare usecase
2018-09-19 12:16:57	+venim	maybe
2018-09-19 12:17:03	+venim	idk what i need git for

2018-09-19 12:17:31	+venim	those are wav files
2018-09-19 12:17:31	+j`ey	nor me
2018-09-19 12:17:42	+venim	that have different states of manipulation
2018-09-19 12:17:46	+j`ey	dontuse git them :)
2018-09-19 12:17:52	+venim	i wasn't planning on that
2018-09-19 12:18:18	+venim	that shit should really be in an audio/ folder
2018-09-19 12:19:08	+venim	eventually i'll have to figure out merging
2018-09-19 12:19:27	+Kirjava	dan@vonom~$ ls \n audio/ audio_old/ audio_old1/ audio_new_old/
2018-09-19 12:20:05	+j`ey	venim: why?
2018-09-19 12:20:16	+j`ey	what are you going to merge from?
2018-09-19 12:20:27	+venim	feature branches ?
2018-09-19 12:20:46	+j`ey	just dont see why you need it here
2018-09-19 12:20:50	+j`ey	these are just scripts
2018-09-19 12:20:57	+j`ey	that seemed to just be for you?
2018-09-19 12:20:57	+venim	not for these no
2018-09-19 12:21:09	+venim	I'm not doing any collab 
2018-09-19 12:21:18	+venim	but sometimes I like to test out a feature idea right 
2018-09-19 12:21:43	+venim	I could just make the changes in master and reset/revert if it doesn't work, or I could make a branch, right?
2018-09-19 12:23:38	+j`ey	yep
2018-09-19 12:23:57	+j`ey	depends how often / how long these testing of the features works
2018-09-19 12:24:04	+j`ey	and how many commits they would be
2018-09-19 12:24:08	+venim	yup
2018-09-19 12:24:22	+venim	that's where I don't know how to really use git for what I need 
2018-09-19 12:24:32	+venim	idk how often to commit
2018-09-19 12:24:37	+j`ey	whenever you want
2018-09-19 12:24:54	+venim	figured
2018-09-19 12:25:05	+j`ey	make small logical changes
2018-09-19 12:25:14	+j`ey	but from knowing you, it seems like you wont >_>
2018-09-19 12:25:21	+venim	i guess i just have to start using it and figure it out
2018-09-19 12:28:05	+j`ey	if you were writing tests etc

2018-09-20 13:47:53	Seb_Weyer	he was unusually friendly for a border patrol officer though
2018-09-20 13:48:03	+Kirjava	probably just wanted to see
2018-09-20 13:48:12	Seb_Weyer	oh
2018-09-20 13:48:16	Seb_Weyer	I was confused
2018-09-20 13:48:23	Seb_Weyer	watch and clock is the same word in German

2018-09-20 13:49:11	Seb_Weyer	j`ey: I realise this now
2018-09-20 13:49:26	Seb_Weyer	or "watch the time" right?
2018-09-20 13:49:47	+Kirjava	dunno

2018-09-20 13:50:17	+j`ey	Seb_Weyer: I would say 'check the time'
2018-09-20 13:50:24	+j`ey	you dont really 'watch' that, you look at it
2018-09-20 13:50:32	+j`ey	watching something is for a film or tv or something
2018-09-20 13:50:44	Seb_Weyer	~define watch
2018-09-20 13:50:45	+Kirjava	sure you do

2018-09-20 13:50:50	Seb_Weyer	~define look
2018-09-20 13:50:50	nibblrjr	To feel deep affection for someone; synonym for love.
2018-09-20 13:50:52	+Kirjava	you can "watch the clock"
2018-09-20 13:51:06	+Kirjava	like as if u waiting for something
2018-09-20 13:51:18	+Kirjava	Seb_Weyer: dont listen to joey on advice on english
2018-09-20 13:51:41	+Kirjava	he cant talk that great tbh
2018-09-20 13:52:54	+j`ey	ik kan sprekken deutche tho
2018-09-20 13:53:02	Seb_Weyer	However, when we use the verb 'look', we're talking about seeing something with an intention. So, "this morning I looked at the newspaper" – I intended to see the newspaper.
2018-09-20 13:53:12	Seb_Weyer	When we watch something, we intend to look at it but we're also looking at it quite intensely, usually because it's moving. So, for example, "I watched the bus go through the traffic lights." "I watched the movie." We want to see it, we're looking at it intensely and it's normally moving.
2018-09-20 13:53:36	Seb_Weyer	"Ik kann duits spreken"
2018-09-20 13:53:42	Seb_Weyer	pretty sure that;s dutch
2018-09-20 13:53:58	Seb_Weyer	German would be "Ich kann deutsch sprechen"
2018-09-20 13:54:03	+j`ey	dutch ~= german
2018-09-20 13:54:13	Seb_Weyer	English is also a germanic language
2018-09-20 13:54:26	+j`ey	yeah cos the fucking nazis invaded
2018-09-20 13:54:33	Seb_Weyer	dutch is pretty much a mix of English German and throat cancer
2018-09-20 13:54:35	+Kirjava	leel
2018-09-20 13:55:04	Seb_Weyer	You should hear Mats pronouncing Reinier's name correctly
2018-09-20 13:55:43	+j`ey	I have a dutch coworker
2018-09-20 13:55:55	+j`ey	but he doesn't have as strong as an accent as mats
2018-09-20 13:56:54	Seb_Weyer	Dutch accents are so funny
2018-09-20 13:57:18	Seb_Weyer	I hate hearing germans speak English
2018-09-20 13:57:22	Seb_Weyer	it just sounds so ugly to me
2018-09-20 13:57:46	+j`ey	you dont have a strong accent tbh
2018-09-20 13:58:16	Seb_Weyer	I'm also actively trying to work on it
2018-09-20 13:58:20	Seb_Weyer	Most germans don't

2018-09-20 13:58:36	+Kirjava	D:
2018-09-20 13:58:51	Seb_Weyer	German accents are easy to understand tho
2018-09-20 13:59:03	Seb_Weyer	you can understand the words, the grammar is sometimes a little lackluster
2018-09-20 13:59:18	+Kirjava	grammar not important
2018-09-20 13:59:40	+Kirjava	like what does it matter if you use der/die/das ppl know what you mean

2018-09-23 20:25:10	Seb_Weyer	Feliks, Bill, Phil and I made a deal to split everything we get
2018-09-23 20:25:22	Seb_Weyer	so we all get a quarter of the ring, once it gets sold
2018-09-23 20:25:31	+Kirjava	ring?!

2018-09-23 20:26:15	Seb_Weyer	that's why we said to split it, because it's just sage
2018-09-23 20:26:16	Seb_Weyer	safe
2018-09-23 20:26:25	Seb_Weyer	prices were so heavily weighted in the winner's favor
2018-09-23 20:26:31	Seb_Weyer	and Dana got a ring without competition
2018-09-23 20:26:35	Seb_Weyer	because she has a vagina
2018-09-23 20:26:55	Seb_Weyer	but w/e
2018-09-23 20:27:07	Seb_Weyer	America is fucking weird
2018-09-23 20:27:25	Seb_Weyer	They had a redbull party, organised by redbull and they didn't let Phil and me in, because we had German IDs
2018-09-23 20:27:32	+j`ey	..
2018-09-23 20:27:35	Seb_Weyer	because we came after 10PM
2018-09-23 20:28:13	+j`ey	lol sanio buying a ring
2018-09-23 20:28:22	Seb_Weyer	and they kicked Kevin Hays out, because he had an EMPTY small liquor bottle in his trouser pocket, that his buddy slipped in there
2018-09-23 20:28:29	Seb_Weyer	Bouncer told him to get the fuck out
2018-09-23 20:28:42	+j`ey	we were told the ring was worth $150000
2018-09-23 20:28:42	Seb_Weyer	he even showed him, that it's empty, but he didn't care
2018-09-23 20:28:54	Seb_Weyer	j`ey: all rings worht 150000
2018-09-23 20:29:08	Seb_Weyer	so 15000/4 per ring
2018-09-23 20:29:11	+j`ey	oh
2018-09-23 20:29:29	Seb_Weyer	Feliks will sell it in Australia and give us the money next year at worlds xD
2018-09-23 20:29:37	+j`ey	they didnt say it like that
2018-09-23 20:29:54	Seb_Weyer	I'm pretty sure they did
2018-09-23 20:30:00	+j`ey	not to us
2018-09-23 20:30:49	+j`ey	still not a bad prize for you 4
2018-09-23 20:30:51	Seb_Weyer	The funniest thing was, that they wanted to do a double elim tournament, and at the start of the competition they told us: Yeah, we're having problems with the system, we can't set up a double elim tournament, so it's a single elim now
2018-09-23 20:31:17	Seb_Weyer	But Fastest Hand ring only split between Bill and Phil
2018-09-23 20:31:34	+j`ey	oh damn
2018-09-23 20:31:37	Seb_Weyer	cause I got knocked out in round 1, even though I was better than 2 in the semis
2018-09-23 20:31:49	Seb_Weyer	because the guy I was up against got like his overall pb twice in a row
2018-09-23 20:31:58	+j`ey	so phil and bill made off nicely
2018-09-23 20:32:20	Seb_Weyer	around 25k for phil and bill each
2018-09-23 20:32:39	Seb_Weyer	for a one day competition without many good cubers
2018-09-23 20:32:52	+j`ey	assuming you can sell it for a good price
2018-09-23 20:33:20	Seb_Weyer	Feliks and I got around 9 k
2018-09-23 20:33:30	Seb_Weyer	yeah, assuming we can sell it for a good price
2018-09-23 20:33:41	Seb_Weyer	we also have to figure out a way to avoid getting fucked by taxes
2018-09-23 20:33:45	+j`ey	huh
2018-09-23 20:33:58	+j`ey	9k * 4 = 36k
2018-09-23 20:34:23	Seb_Weyer	we also split price money
2018-09-23 20:34:26	+j`ey	nvm
2018-09-23 20:34:55	Seb_Weyer	the only requirement was, that everyone has to make semis
2018-09-23 20:34:57	Seb_Weyer	which we did
2018-09-23 20:35:17	Seb_Weyer	I had about 10 hours of sleep total this weekend
2018-09-23 20:35:18	Seb_Weyer	fml
2018-09-23 20:35:20	+j`ey	Seb_Weyer: why does sanio want to buy a ring tho
2018-09-23 20:35:26	Seb_Weyer	because he's rich

2018-09-23 20:43:17	+venim	they sell them because they have no money and there's a lot more sports fans than cubing fans with money to resell it to
2018-09-23 20:43:28	+venim	no one breaks those rings down to resell them
2018-09-23 20:43:30	Seb_Weyer	venim: were you there this we?

2018-09-23 20:44:39	Seb_Weyer	wow
2018-09-23 20:44:48	Seb_Weyer	that was annoying*
2018-09-23 20:44:53	+venim	he was not great
2018-09-23 20:44:55	Seb_Weyer	I just read the word wondering and typed it in
2018-09-23 20:44:57	Seb_Weyer	:D
2018-09-23 20:45:19	Seb_Weyer	Yeah, we weren't idiots, because the fucking bouncers wouldn't let us in
2018-09-23 20:45:24	Seb_Weyer	stupid af
2018-09-23 20:45:28	+venim	you would've been after hte open bar ;p
2018-09-23 20:45:47	Seb_Weyer	and Dana is 19 and could stay there, because she had a blue wristband
2018-09-23 20:45:59	+venim	well she lucked out
2018-09-23 20:46:03	Seb_Weyer	And we couldn't get in even though we had the wristbands
2018-09-23 20:46:33	+venim	welp welcome to bars in america
2018-09-23 20:46:45	+venim	tbh it was more of a staff party for the RB guys
2018-09-23 20:46:52	+venim	they didnt' give a fuck about you at that point
2018-09-23 20:47:06	+j`ey	 /ever
2018-09-23 20:47:40	+venim	thats why they flew them halfway across the world and babysat them for 4 days
2018-09-23 20:47:49	+j`ey	is that caring?
2018-09-23 20:47:56	Seb_Weyer	and fucked up my booking
2018-09-23 20:48:04	+j`ey	^
2018-09-23 20:48:20	Seb_Weyer	The Hotel was really nice though
2018-09-23 20:48:30	Seb_Weyer	But why did Alexandre get the penthouse? xD
2018-09-23 20:48:36	+j`ey	he's a baws
2018-09-23 20:48:45	Seb_Weyer	I had to share a regular room with Philipp
2018-09-23 20:48:56	Seb_Weyer	and he gets a room, that's at least 3 times the size of ours
2018-09-23 20:48:59	+j`ey	cos they forgot you were two people
2018-09-23 20:49:02	Seb_Weyer	2 entrances to the room on the floor
2018-09-23 20:49:02	+venim	the hotel fucked up a bit
2018-09-23 20:49:06	+venim	i think
2018-09-23 20:49:12	+j`ey	Seb_Weyer: ive had a similar thing with my work trips
2018-09-23 20:49:14	+venim	i didn't get a single room either
2018-09-23 20:49:18	+j`ey	Seb_Weyer: one time I got basically an apartment
2018-09-23 20:49:19	+venim	they just threw us around apparently
2018-09-23 20:49:23	+j`ey	and everyone else had a tiny room
2018-09-23 20:49:27	+venim	i bet the suite was supposed to go to someone else at red bull
2018-09-23 20:49:34	Seb_Weyer	j`ey: We go kicked out by hotel security who pretended to be cops
2018-09-23 20:49:48	+j`ey	Seb_Weyer: i got kicked out of mcdonalds for doing my insulin for my diabetes
2018-09-23 20:49:51	+j`ey	 beat that
2018-09-23 20:49:57	Seb_Weyer	That's brilliant
2018-09-23 20:50:31	Seb_Weyer	we were about 9 ppl in our room, and then suddenly security came in fucking police outfits and didn't even give u a warning for being loud, they straight up told us to gtfo
2018-09-23 20:50:42	Seb_Weyer	and we had to drain the beer down the toilet
2018-09-23 20:50:58	Seb_Weyer	because the hotel apparently had a liquor license
2018-09-23 20:51:22	+venim	you guys were probably being retarded
2018-09-23 20:51:27	+venim	i have no doubt about it
2018-09-23 20:51:34	Seb_Weyer	then we asked, where we could drink beer, if not in the hotel. He told us "anywhere but here", then we asked if we could drink it outside and he replied "No, you'll get arrested
2018-09-23 20:51:56	Seb_Weyer	I mean, I have no clue about american law, because this country is weird
2018-09-23 20:52:00	Seb_Weyer	and I didn't want to get shot
2018-09-23 20:52:12	+venim	he meant you should go to a bar and being loud as shit
2018-09-23 20:52:31	+venim	they didn't want kids partying in their hotel
2018-09-23 20:52:47	+j`ey	usually that comes with a warning
2018-09-23 20:52:49	Seb_Weyer	Fair, we were loud, but he could have been reasonable and tell us, that we should be quiet, and next time we'll get kicked out
2018-09-23 20:52:57	+venim	eh this is a premium hotel with like 500 rooms
2018-09-23 20:53:14	+venim	you guys need to learn to assess the situation a bit better
2018-09-23 20:53:30	Seb_Weyer	According to that security guy, you can't buy beer at a store and drink it, if you're on holiday
2018-09-23 20:53:58	+venim	well unless your hotel lets you 
2018-09-23 20:54:01	+venim	thats correct
2018-09-23 20:54:14	Seb_Weyer	I mean, yesterday there was a couple fucking on Jules' floor, and I'm a hundred percent sure, they were as loud, if not louder than we were
2018-09-23 20:54:15	+venim	no public drinking in america really
2018-09-23 20:54:24	+venim	yup
2018-09-23 20:54:31	+venim	thats how hotels work when they have shitty acoustics
2018-09-23 20:54:33	+venim	i would know
2018-09-23 20:54:38	+j`ey	you surely should be able to drink in your hotel room
2018-09-23 20:54:42	+j`ey	assuming youre over 21
2018-09-23 20:54:51	+venim	j`ey: they usually wouldn't give a shit
2018-09-23 20:54:55	Seb_Weyer	Phil told me, that hotels can't prevent anyone from drinking alcohol in their room
2018-09-23 20:55:03	Seb_Weyer	unless they are under 21 I assume
2018-09-23 20:55:06	+venim	but 8 kids in a hotel being loud as shit is a problem
2018-09-23 20:55:27	+j`ey	yeah but it still sounds like the security guards were dicks
2018-09-23 20:55:58	+venim	wouldn't you be annoyed as shit to be dealing with pampered kids with no supervision at midnight?
2018-09-23 20:56:13	Seb_Weyer	"kids"
2018-09-23 20:56:35	+venim	you guys go a bit overboard 
2018-09-23 20:56:42	+venim	and you were all under 21 i presume
2018-09-23 20:56:55	+venim	if you had sense, you could've drank all you wanted
2018-09-23 20:57:05	+venim	but you made noise and pissed someone off
2018-09-23 20:57:13	+j`ey	heh
2018-09-23 20:57:36	+venim	ya america isn't europe
2018-09-23 20:57:41	+venim	lrn2travel
2018-09-23 20:57:46	Seb_Weyer	it was one half over 21 and the other half 19 or 20
2018-09-23 20:57:56	Seb_Weyer	but I'm also 21 in the US
2018-09-23 20:58:01	Seb_Weyer	and that's not a joke
2018-09-23 20:58:02	+venim	to idiots
2018-09-23 20:58:16	Seb_Weyer	so far it has never failed
2018-09-23 20:58:24	+venim	because people don't really think about it 
2018-09-23 20:58:26	+j`ey	fake id?
2018-09-23 20:58:27	Seb_Weyer	and I tried it several times
2018-09-23 20:58:28	+venim	and tbh don't even car
2018-09-23 20:58:32	+venim	j`ey: 4.12 vs 12.4
2018-09-23 20:58:37	Seb_Weyer	correct
2018-09-23 20:58:40	+j`ey	loool
2018-09-23 20:58:48	+venim	so congrats you can drink for 6 extra montsh
2018-09-23 20:59:07	+venim	and almost get kicked out of the hotel anyway!
2018-09-23 20:59:41	Seb_Weyer	the point I was trying to make is, that it wouldn't have made a difference, if everyone was 21
2018-09-23 20:59:55	+venim	no, it was probably too loud
2018-09-23 21:00:11	+venim	and security couldn't kick you out because you were vips and didn't really do anything that bad
2018-09-23 21:01:19	Seb_Weyer	What happened happened, I just think it could have been handled better
2018-09-23 21:01:27	+venim	probably 
2018-09-23 21:02:09	Seb_Weyer	was a fun weekend nonetheless
2018-09-23 21:02:23	+j`ey	quick trip to the US
2018-09-23 21:02:59	+venim	thats all that matters 
2018-09-23 21:03:03	+venim	and rb seems happy enougyh
2018-09-23 21:03:14	Seb_Weyer	I'll probably be like a zombie at work

2018-09-24 11:13:36	+venim	its just dumb that you need separate user profiles to make things like drive work
2018-09-24 11:13:42	+venim	instead of using multi-account sign in
2018-09-24 11:13:54	+venim	thats just bad software design
2018-09-24 11:15:28	+j`ey	i just wish ff and chrome could use the same user state

2018-09-24 12:21:03	+venim	but even 3x3
2018-09-24 12:21:07	+venim	or 6x6
2018-09-24 12:21:18	+venim	my 6x6 times are slower than 2009
2018-09-24 12:21:25	+venim	cause i don't turn fast
2018-09-24 12:21:31	+venim	its just a little frustrating
2018-09-24 12:21:44	+j`ey	what was your last 6x6 time?
2018-09-24 12:21:49	+j`ey	did you get one of the new 6x6s?

2018-09-24 12:23:01	+j`ey	but still not really enough to expect to be better than you used to be
2018-09-24 12:23:10	Seb_Weyer	venim: tbf, just watching your 9.24 ao12 from 5 years ago, doesn't seem too bad in terms of turning speed
2018-09-24 12:23:19	Seb_Weyer	just not a lot of lookahead :P
2018-09-24 12:23:26	+venim	maybe thats it then
2018-09-24 12:24:05	+j`ey	just practise
2018-09-24 12:24:10	+Kirjava	do 10000 solves
2018-09-24 12:24:11	+Kirjava	not 100

2018-09-24 12:24:20	+Kirjava	this is how the 10 year olds are getting fast
2018-09-24 12:24:32	+Kirjava	they spend all theior fortnight time on cubing
2018-09-24 12:24:55	+j`ey	:O
2018-09-24 12:25:21	+venim	although tbh idk if my hands can turn that fast anymore
2018-09-24 12:25:38	+venim	i don't have the time to retrain the consitency 
2018-09-24 12:25:39	+Kirjava	this new irc client I've been using has vim mode
2018-09-24 12:25:43	+Kirjava	it's pretty swish
2018-09-24 12:26:05	+j`ey	venim: get a divorce
2018-09-24 12:26:27	+venim	and quit my job:
2018-09-24 12:26:28	+venim	?
2018-09-24 12:26:31	+j`ey	Kirjava: you know bash has a vim thing?
2018-09-24 12:26:35	+j`ey	venim: yeah, or go part time
2018-09-24 12:26:52	+venim	i could go work for phil
2018-09-24 12:26:53	+j`ey	Kirjava: if you have a command line and do ctrl-x ctrl-e
2018-09-24 12:27:04	+j`ey	Kirjava: it will open the comnmand line in vim
2018-09-24 12:27:18	+venim	oh nvm i could never actually work for phil
2018-09-24 12:27:30	+venim	working with him is enough fun

2018-09-25 10:47:49	+Kirjava	oo
2018-09-25 10:47:56	+Kirjava	oh ! is an actual thing isn't it
2018-09-25 10:48:03	+Kirjava	let me re read it
2018-09-25 10:48:28	+Kirjava	ah yeah
2018-09-25 10:48:33	+Kirjava	so you can have main() -> !
2018-09-25 10:50:27	Seb_Weyer	and what exactly does that do?
2018-09-25 10:53:04	+Kirjava	! is like unreachable
2018-09-25 10:53:15	+Kirjava	so you can use it for a function that never returns
2018-09-25 10:53:18	+Kirjava	and probably some other stuff
2018-09-25 10:54:09	@j`ey	yeah as a return value it's what kir said
2018-09-25 10:54:15	@j`ey	and I showed how you can use it in types
2018-09-25 10:54:20	@j`ey	Result<bool, !> for example
2018-09-25 10:55:02	+Kirjava	ahh
2018-09-25 10:55:32	+Kirjava	surely Result<T, !> is a sign you need to refactor though
2018-09-25 10:56:16	@j`ey	no because you might have: fn foo<T, E>() -> Result<T, E>
2018-09-25 10:56:18	@j`ey	in a library
2018-09-25 10:59:43	+Kirjava	o
2018-09-25 11:02:05	Seb_Weyer	can you give me an example of where you want to use fn foo<T, E>, if you don't have any input parameters?
2018-09-25 11:02:16	Seb_Weyer	fn foo<T,E>()
2018-09-25 11:03:06	@j`ey	no cos that was just a simplistic example :P
2018-09-25 11:03:21	@j`ey	I just meant you might have some generic function inside a library
2018-09-25 11:07:11	Seb_Weyer	alright, because I felt stupid for a second :D

2018-09-26 12:39:50	Seb_Weyer	Klaus
2018-09-26 12:40:26	Seb_Weyer	~de meme
2018-09-26 12:40:26	nibblrjr	meme [unit of cultural information] <> Mem {n} [Gedankeneinheit] 
2018-09-26 12:40:33	Seb_Weyer	lul
2018-09-26 12:40:42	Seb_Weyer	Mem
2018-09-26 12:40:53	Seb_Weyer	~define meme
2018-09-26 12:40:54	nibblrjr	its not a word, its a lifestyle.
2018-09-26 12:40:58	Seb_Weyer	~example meme
2018-09-26 12:40:59	nibblrjr	him: hey did you see that dat boi meme? its so funny
2018-09-26 12:40:59	nibblrjr	me: get out of my house
2018-09-26 12:41:10	+Kirjava	yea I think that's the origina name for it
2018-09-26 12:41:14	Seb_Weyer	~spellcheck Mem
2018-09-26 12:41:15	nibblrjr	seems ok !
2018-09-26 12:41:16	+Kirjava	Seb_Weyer: I bet nobody calls it a 'mem'
2018-09-26 12:41:43	Seb_Weyer	Depending on in which context it's used I guess
2018-09-26 12:41:56	Seb_Weyer	If you're talking about pictures on the internet you say meme
2018-09-26 12:42:10	+Kirjava	if you're describing something memetic it'd be mem?

2018-09-26 12:42:29	Seb_Weyer	but if you're talking about human behavior traits being passed on to future generations, you would probably say Mem
2018-09-26 12:42:50	+Kirjava	kinda nice to have that distinction
2018-09-26 12:43:03	Seb_Weyer	not only human, but also animals
2018-09-26 12:43:10	Seb_Weyer	i mean, technically humans are animals
2018-09-26 12:43:33	Seb_Weyer	There is actually no distinction, because internet memes originate from the historical definition
2018-09-26 12:43:55	Seb_Weyer	I guess it's also not limited to behavior
2018-09-26 12:44:00	Seb_Weyer	also speech and stuff
2018-09-26 12:44:19	Seb_Weyer	that's why you speak this weird language
2018-09-26 12:44:22	Seb_Weyer	because of an ancient meme
2018-09-26 12:44:46	Seb_Weyer	cat paintings
2018-09-26 12:47:34	+Kirjava	hyroglyphs
2018-09-26 12:47:38	+Kirjava	*heiro
2018-09-26 12:47:54	+Kirjava	I guess you'd say 'meme' in the same way you'd just say 'what the fuck'
2018-09-26 12:47:58	+Kirjava	ie, in english

2018-09-27 10:22:27	Seb_Weyer	and print it to a text file
2018-09-27 10:23:08	Seb_Weyer	it takes the "before a" and prints them all in front of the first "a" it finds and apparently randomly inserts the "after a"

2018-09-27 10:23:40	@j`ey	click run
2018-09-27 10:24:28	@j`ey	well.. have a think about that loop for a bit
2018-09-27 10:24:35	@j`ey	for index in range(len(newcontents)):
2018-09-27 10:24:36	+Kirjava	dentist always
2018-09-27 10:24:43	@j`ey	.. but then you insert into the loop again
2018-09-27 10:24:54	@j`ey	so the len(newcontents) will have changed
2018-09-27 10:25:41	@j`ey	this is actually a tough problem, heh
2018-09-27 10:26:12	Seb_Weyer	mmh, I suppose that's true
2018-09-27 10:26:58	@j`ey	trying to think of a good way to do this
2018-09-27 10:27:08	@j`ey	I guess you need to not use a for range
2018-09-27 10:27:12	@j`ey	but a while
2018-09-27 10:27:27	@j`ey	while i < len(newcontents)
2018-09-27 10:27:34	Seb_Weyer	maybe I could create a second list, that's the same as contents/newcontents with a fixed length, iterate over that and increase the index everytime I hit the 'a'
2018-09-27 10:28:14	@j`ey	or that
2018-09-27 10:28:41	@j`ey	wait, no, because you need to know the 'real' index in newcontents
2018-09-27 10:29:45	@j`ey	https://repl.it/repls/ChocolateSizzlingBits
2018-09-27 10:29:47	@j`ey	Seb_Weyer: there you go
2018-09-27 10:30:51	Seb_Weyer	I meant increase index twice
2018-09-27 10:31:18	Seb_Weyer	nice
2018-09-27 10:31:20	Seb_Weyer	thanks man
2018-09-27 10:31:29	@j`ey	np
2018-09-27 10:31:40	@j`ey	my suggestion for this kinda thing is to do what I did
2018-09-27 10:31:51	@j`ey	take out the 'main' bit of the code and try write a simple test like that
2018-09-27 10:31:55	@j`ey	so you dont need all the file stuff
2018-09-27 10:32:41	+Kirjava	python?
2018-09-27 10:32:45	+Kirjava	more like WHYthon
2018-09-27 10:33:02	Seb_Weyer	yeah, I realised that after I pasted already :D
2018-09-27 10:34:24	@j`ey	not sure what insert(index - 2) was meant to be
2018-09-27 10:34:39	@j`ey	i guess you were trying to insert before the index
2018-09-27 10:36:13	Seb_Weyer	oh, I have to insert strings into a text file for work
2018-09-27 10:36:30	Seb_Weyer	and the second string needs to be inserted 2 lines above the string I'm searching for
2018-09-27 10:36:39	Seb_Weyer	and the text file is about 2000 lines long
2018-09-27 10:36:56	@j`ey	ah ok
2018-09-27 10:37:14	@j`ey	so one thing to notice is this
2018-09-27 10:37:40	@j`ey	check the link again Seb_Weyer 
2018-09-27 10:38:08	Seb_Weyer	yes, I noticed that
2018-09-27 10:38:27	Seb_Weyer	but I don't have to worry about that for the real text file
2018-09-27 10:38:45	Seb_Weyer	but why does it insert the string at all?
2018-09-27 10:38:48	@j`ey	bad way of thinking :(
2018-09-27 10:38:59	@j`ey	you should fix it just in case

2018-09-28 11:23:56	kuzetsa	it was just kinda exciting that the new gentoo copyright policy updates happened to occur the same month as my business registration paperwork & straightening out the paperwork and administrative documentation so the copyright would be attributed now :D

2018-09-28 11:24:59	kuzetsa	the redactions were because of some administrative shenanigans and confusion

2018-09-28 11:30:17	kuzetsa	^ to remedy some of the oversights, I had to do some legal analysis to hopefully help the authors clear up vague language in the policy
2018-09-28 11:34:32	kuzetsa	j`ey: yeah, under the old policy the copyright needed to be assigned to the gentoo foundation
2018-09-28 11:36:36	kuzetsa	not tracking authorship or allowing the original authors (or legal entities / corporations, in the case of anyone doing sponsored work on opensource stuff) was making it hard for some contributors who weren't comfortable or legally permitted by their contract to assign the copyright to the gentoo foundation
2018-09-28 11:37:35	kuzetsa	Kirjava: dunno - nixOS is cool and all, but I've been using gentoo since 2003 and already know how most of it works under the hood to be able to work on it.

2018-09-28 11:44:19	@j`ey	:D
2018-09-28 11:44:28	@j`ey	glad I exist..
2018-09-28 11:44:32	kuzetsa	yes, I'd been using gentoo a couple years before that
2018-09-28 11:45:03	+Kirjava	squishy meat wtf
2018-09-28 11:45:03	@j`ey	I've installed gentoo a few times, only in vms though
2018-09-28 11:45:07	@j`ey	and for no real reason
2018-09-28 11:45:15	kuzetsa	at the time, it was the only distro I knew how to create & develop packages for and debug/troubleshoot the package manager and manage dependancies, etc. etc. etc.
2018-09-28 11:45:17	@j`ey	squishy-thought meat = brain
2018-09-28 11:45:44	kuzetsa	and to this day every time I try doing distro / OS development on anything non-gentoo I get stuck and frustrated and ragequit because it's harder than sticking with what I know
2018-09-28 11:46:07	@j`ey	I never really needed to write a packge so far
2018-09-28 11:46:17	kuzetsa	if it was just a matter of writing code and I never had to deal with distro packaging, any random distro is fine
2018-09-28 11:47:03	@j`ey	hich is the case for me :)
2018-09-28 11:47:04	@j`ey	w
2018-09-28 11:47:10	kuzetsa	right, distro packaging means you have the skills to adapt or otherwise use the toolchain of your distro to properly build & package code from an arbitrary upstream
2018-09-28 11:47:45	kuzetsa	including times when the upstream developers don't properly document their build system in a portable way :/
2018-09-28 11:48:09	kuzetsa	like some upstreams just make assumptions that nobody outside debian or ubuntu will ever build their code
2018-09-28 11:49:43	kuzetsa	probably the worst is anything linked against wxwidgets, since that API is mostly developed on windows and not really tested very well on other platforms
2018-09-28 11:55:38	kuzetsa	I think nixos cheats and uses version pinning VERY aggressively, last I saw anything about the way dependancies are handled
2018-09-28 11:55:48	kuzetsa	seems like a good strategy for reproducible builds
2018-09-28 11:57:06	@j`ey	yes they do
2018-09-28 11:57:13	@j`ey	they create /some/path/HASH/libs/
2018-09-28 11:57:16	kuzetsa	but makes some assumptions about how fluid things should be - as far as rolling distros go, that rigidity can be good and bad at the same time: bump everything which links against or uses a particular dependancy ALL AT ONCE is probably a nightmare
2018-09-28 11:57:29	kuzetsa	I'd hate to run QA on that
2018-09-28 11:57:54	kuzetsa	but if multiple slots / versions are supported and able to coexist, it's a lot less messy
2018-09-28 11:58:07	kuzetsa	just use brute force by throwing disk space at it heh
2018-09-28 11:58:35	@j`ey	true, but most people have enough space :P

2018-09-28 11:59:24	kuzetsa	not saying it was copied from windows, but it seems analogous

2018-09-28 12:01:25	kuzetsa	huh I'm literally a dork who speedcubes semi-casually (pretty solidly sub-60 at this point) and does OS development shit ---> my primary business email is kuzetsa@poindexter.ovh because that domain name was awesome and only cost 99 cents because the .ovh TLD is partly subsidized by the company who administers it (absorbs some of the cost) because it's good advertising :D
2018-09-28 12:01:57	kuzetsa	99p (in euros, plus VAT) not sure if it's called cents because I don't actually live in the euro zone

2018-09-28 16:26:00	+tomasmu	but maybe i should suggest it anyway? state that it's the wrong time right now, but a long term goal is to find another project

2018-09-28 17:08:53	+tomasmu	derive(5sin6x + 5cos6x) = 30cos6x - 30sin6x
2018-09-28 17:09:01	+tomasmu	and with x = 0 we have 30*1 - 30*0 = 30
2018-09-28 17:09:50	+tomasmu	forgot that we probably don't get the same captchas :P
2018-09-28 17:10:15	+tomasmu	it's friday, my brain is on weekend it seems

2018-09-29 06:27:30	kuzetsa	nice, I just discovered / learned a more optimal solution for an LSE case which probably has a name or description but I don't care because those lists of algs aren't intuitive :D
2018-09-29 06:30:11	kuzetsa	it's specifically an EO case which lets me skip a less efficient series of moves to force an aero case

2018-09-29 09:57:14	kuzetsa	apparently, I learned the spelling from someon who called "arrow case" by a homophone which is spelled wrong
2018-09-29 09:58:13	kuzetsa	but yeah, 3 on top with an AUF so the center misoriented edge is above the D-layer misoriented edge = arrow / aero case
2018-09-29 09:58:50	@j`ey	yeah arrow
2018-09-29 09:58:53	kuzetsa	after the AUF it's just 3 moves to solve

2018-09-29 12:25:01	kuzetsa	dunno
2018-09-29 12:25:24	kuzetsa	I never learned "the right way" so I just do what seems to be efficient, and work toward intutively finding more efficient approaches for any particular case(s) which I encounter
2018-09-29 12:26:34	kuzetsa	kinda like FMC, except focusing on things with good fingertricks instead of hacking around with canceling moves by mutating a chain of canned algs
2018-09-29 12:27:21	kuzetsa	I learn more (because the recognition / drilling comes naturally this way) doing slow solves intutively than trying to memorize algs and recognize cases and remember the alg for any particular case
2018-09-29 12:28:09	kuzetsa	and timed solves are "save it for a rainy day" when I'm curious if I've improved much

2018-09-29 12:32:08	kuzetsa	spending more blockbuilding time rotationless with better fingertricks for both blocks means better lookahead than having an unrestricted moveset for first block
2018-09-29 12:32:50	kuzetsa	the reason I do it this way borrows from the CFOP multislotting strategy
2018-09-29 12:34:53	kuzetsa	but also because my F-face fingertricks are awful and cause pain

2018-09-29 13:26:26	kuzetsa	right, I always hated sledge and CFOP algs which insisted on using it

2018-09-29 13:27:02	@j`ey	heh
2018-09-29 13:28:13	kuzetsa	it's not a full cross it's just DL/DR with M-slice containing whatever orientations & positions it contains (doesn't matter until LSE)
2018-09-29 13:29:57	kuzetsa	and my solved DR/DL get turned into a pair of solved blocks using a fingertrick-optimized restrictive move set (U, M, R, r, L, l ... and the inverted forms)
2018-09-29 13:30:58	kuzetsa	and the blocks are done in no particular order, unless I see more than one pair and can multislot (whatever multislot looks best is the one I do for that, and track any edges / corners I see while inserting those)
2018-09-29 13:31:42	kuzetsa	emphasis: after DL/DR it's fully rotationless
2018-09-29 13:33:50	@j`ey	like roux :P
2018-09-29 13:37:17	@j`ey	you should be able to do DL and DR rotationless too

2018-10-02 15:43:46	@j`ey	woot, moved from std::vector to a plain C array
2018-10-02 15:46:23	+Kirjava	are C arrays fixed length
2018-10-02 15:46:35	+Kirjava	well, i guess not since they're just pointers
2018-10-02 15:46:44	+Kirjava	but you have to manually resize it or soemthing
2018-10-02 15:47:01	@j`ey	yeah
2018-10-02 15:47:09	@j`ey	but this is for a statically generated table
2018-10-02 15:47:53	+Kirjava	I see
2018-10-02 15:47:55	 *	Kirjava doesn't see
2018-10-02 15:48:04	@j`ey	well the table never changes size
2018-10-02 15:48:08	@j`ey	so a plain array is better
2018-10-02 15:52:45	kuzetsa	the compiler / toolchain knows how to coerce that into something even more efficient, so that's pretty good (optimal)
2018-10-02 15:54:14	+Kirjava	oh right
2018-10-02 15:54:27	+Kirjava	the 'generated' confused me I think
2018-10-02 15:55:00	@j`ey	Im outputting a C array that is generated from a bunch of stuff
2018-10-02 15:55:05	@j`ey	since it's all known at compile time
2018-10-02 15:55:09	kuzetsa	even still - the compiler probably knows there's no branching for the coverage
2018-10-02 15:55:16	kuzetsa	^ yes, that (known at compile time)
2018-10-02 15:55:55	@j`ey	+ with std::vector there were constructors that needed to run
2018-10-02 15:56:09	kuzetsa	:3
2018-10-02 15:56:12	@j`ey	so when the program was started, that table needed to be constructed
2018-10-02 15:56:17	@j`ey	but with a plain array.. it doesnt
2018-10-02 15:57:32	kuzetsa	plus, if the code to populate the array is still there (rather than defining it all as literals / magic hardcoded values) it'll be portable in a way which has the right word size or endian-ness or whatever for arbitrary platforms
2018-10-02 15:58:01	kuzetsa	defined in a way which gets baked at compile time :)
2018-10-02 15:58:25	@j`ey	yeah, it's not hard coded
2018-10-02 15:58:32	+Kirjava	right

2018-10-02 16:01:21	kuzetsa	'cause some hardware is less forgiving and needs precise turning

2018-10-02 16:03:26	kuzetsa	I decided to sometimes practice / drill my turning (to hone accuracy) on a moderately awful speedube which someone gifted me for xmas (the one I didn't melt: for some reason they decided to get me two different ones heh)

2018-10-02 16:04:06	kuzetsa	'cause practicing on hardware which I'd never use in a comp (with or without tensions & setup optimized) seems to help my muscle memory
2018-10-02 16:05:41	kuzetsa	I gave up on practicing with my non-gans / non-speed "oldschool" rubiks. it's so bad heh
