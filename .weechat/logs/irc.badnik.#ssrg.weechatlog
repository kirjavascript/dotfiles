2018-09-19 03:28:17	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> @Jorge Would have been more complicated than that, remember that Sonic 1 was developed on a text editors on PC-9801VM machines.
2018-09-19 03:28:44	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> Speaking of which, the programmers of Sonic the Hedgehog used NEC PC-9801VM machines.
2018-09-19 03:39:18	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> They likely assembled with 2500 A.D.'s x68k, given the evidence we had in the past.
2018-09-19 03:39:56	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> "lib" files, .x68 files, etc.
2018-09-19 03:45:29	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> I've always wondered what the "Layout Sections" button was for in SonLVL, and what it does...
2018-09-19 03:46:43	%MainMemory	you can select a section of the level and save it to paste it somewhere else later
2018-09-19 03:47:09	%MainMemory	or import an image directly into a layout section so you can paste it multiple times
2018-09-19 03:47:18	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> Oh! That seems quite handy.
2018-09-19 03:47:46	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> That would make my job a little easier.

2018-09-19 19:54:58	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I made a spike bug enabler/disabler monitor and when it was disabled, that happened.
2018-09-19 19:55:10	+Dick-Cord	<S​panNepu> it's not a bug it's a feature
2018-09-19 19:55:55	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I call it a bug. But eh, that's up to you.
2018-09-19 19:56:53	%MainMemory	I can't imagine how someone could program the spikes that way unintentionally
2018-09-19 20:01:02	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> I mean if it were written with that behavior in mind I don't think it would include a check that branches to not killing you if you're already hurt
2018-09-19 20:01:14	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> so either it's an oversight or they changed it last minute
2018-09-19 20:01:19	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> All these double-negatives is giving me a headache
2018-09-19 20:06:05	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> The spike bug exists because of a missing check. That sounds like it could be unintentional to me.
2018-09-19 20:08:08	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Crap
2018-09-19 20:09:30	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> You mean I can't just wish more ram into existence? Is the free ram I downloaded a lie?
2018-09-19 20:09:56	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Even on Discord I get compiling errors, damn you Clownacy.bat!
2018-09-19 20:16:36	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> https://youtu.be/hQ0yeT2sTFI Anyways, final result.
2018-09-19 20:16:37	%ChaosGamma	Title: New Item: Spike - YouTube
2018-09-19 20:38:37	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> The first 68k code I ever wrote on my own was me attempting to toggle the spike bug depending on how many Chaos Emeralds you have. In RR!, if you have I think more then 1 or 2, it stops occurring. Ah the memories...
2018-09-19 20:41:09	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Am I just giving you all these flashbacks? lol
2018-09-19 20:41:30	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> How do you remember the first thing you coded? Lol
2018-09-19 20:41:40	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> I have no idea what mine was
2018-09-19 20:42:10	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> That was about 5 years ago though.
2018-09-19 20:42:18	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Just a lot of funny parallels to where I started. And yeah, I do remember what I first coded, in part because I discussed it in the basic Q&A thread. It's in there somewhere...
2018-09-19 20:42:25	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> The first thing I "coded" was the spindash. But on my own, I'd have to say was making the credits have different themes depending on which character you used.
2018-09-19 20:42:48	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> It might have been time travel
2018-09-19 20:42:56	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Yeah, I'm not counting all the copy/paste tutorials I used prior. They helped me get started though
2018-09-19 20:43:18	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Ah well then yes, the whole credits theme deal.
2018-09-19 20:43:27	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> If we are talking made completely on my own.
2018-09-19 20:45:03	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> I remember five years ago when I found that guide to port Sonic 3's sound driver to Sonic 1 and thought it was the coolest thing ever (read: it's a fucking mess). Then I tried working with the music a little after that and decided never again to use Z80 SMPS.
2018-09-19 20:46:28	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I used that once. ␤Shivers ␤Why
2018-09-19 20:46:30	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> First thing I tried to code on myself but failed is probably the HPZ Shrine from Sonic and Knuckles.
2018-09-19 20:46:53	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Thank god we have SMPS2ASM now, Z80 based music would be a royal pain to add otherwise. Of course, I haven't tried it yet since I'm a big fan of slapping high quality PCM samples on everything, but it'll definitely be something I consider in future projects.
2018-09-19 20:47:28	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> Never figured out how to successfully make sure the super emerald knew it was already stood on and collected.
2018-09-19 20:47:43	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> It would just randomly make one of them not work
2018-09-19 20:47:59	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> as for coding, I don't even remember the first thing I tried to do (I never coded anything of note during my first period of being active)
2018-09-19 20:48:00	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> After finishing one of the special stages
2018-09-19 20:48:24	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Now your giving me flash backs to the early days of RR2s' HPZ special stage system. It tooks ages to finally nail it down and make everything work properly :derpsonic:
2018-09-19 20:49:25	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> though right now my main goal is to get a post-title menu working with a custom background
2018-09-19 20:49:26	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> *You're ␤Sorry
2018-09-19 20:50:00	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> Idk how it worked in S3K like how it teleporters to the shrine, I just made it teleporter me to HPZ with a specific screen position.
2018-09-19 20:50:16	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> And lock it
2018-09-19 20:50:19	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> iz dis b8r, ios klo?
2018-09-19 20:51:12	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> ... ␤*Is this better, Iso Kilo?
2018-09-19 20:51:46	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> Text speech... anything but that.
2018-09-19 20:52:11	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> What about 😂
2018-09-19 20:53:30	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> 👌 😂 💯
2018-09-19 20:53:38	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> Texting has killed human to human contact no wonder so many teenagers now a days have social anxiety.
2018-09-19 20:54:17	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I have social anxiety because I fear that people want to throw me into a trash can like they did 2 years ago, what are you talking about?
2018-09-19 20:55:57	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> Idk what are you talking about? Lol
2018-09-19 20:58:27	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> Not all social anxiety comes from supplementing a lack of human-to-human interaction with texting, but it is a relatively large cause
2018-09-19 20:59:15	+Dick-Cord	<J​oenickROS> I know It plays a big part
2018-09-19 20:59:24	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> Iso, cmp #0, or tst is equivalent, it's just that the compare is slower unless you have "0" already in a register

2018-09-20 17:23:13	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> @Iso Kilo Next time it might be best to go over things and refine them before submitting a guide if you find yourself having to edit it a lot
2018-09-20 17:24:21	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Yeah, but I was rushed by my teachers saying I could write the guide, but I'd also need to finish a new assignment during the same class.
2018-09-20 17:24:44	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Not like that's a good excuse though.
2018-09-20 17:24:53	djohe	that is shit excuse
2018-09-20 17:25:20	djohe	have we not told you not rush stuff
2018-09-20 17:26:01	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> No you just told me not to be too ambitious.
2018-09-20 17:26:36	djohe	deadlines & rushing stuff like sonic hacks and a ton of other things is never a good thing
2018-09-20 17:26:50	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Yeah, simply delaying something is indeed an option. It can take me like half an hour just to clean up some of my larger posts before finally posting them.
2018-09-20 17:27:17	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Well I'll keep that in mind for future threads.
2018-09-20 17:27:44	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> ~~when in doubt, delay delay delay, as i sometimes say~~
2018-09-20 17:27:45	djohe	unless you want people to look at unfinished/broken/whatever stuff
2018-09-20 17:28:18	djohe	and I certainly do not
2018-09-20 17:29:09	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> It wasn't too broken at the time of posting. ␤Just comments were wonky, and I forgot to put a $ in front of some of the placeholder RAM addresses.
2018-09-20 17:29:46	djohe	also I question why you are even making guides
2018-09-20 17:30:05	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> New monitors
2018-09-20 17:30:42	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Oh come on, if they can pull it off themselves without making the game spontaneously combust, I see no reason why they shouldn't make a guide.
2018-09-20 17:31:20	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Especially since it isn't the typical copy/paste nonsense
2018-09-20 17:31:38	djohe	well at the same time there is a reason why a ton of guides and threads were hidden
2018-09-20 17:31:51	djohe	because of quality assurance
2018-09-20 17:32:03	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> While I assure you my guide is of quality.
2018-09-20 17:32:06	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Runs
2018-09-20 17:33:07	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Quality is subjective. imho, if it does what it says it does, and you can get an idea of how it does what it does by reading or following the guide, then it should stay.

2018-09-20 17:36:00	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Does what it says it does, check. Can figure out what it's doing by looking at the comments, check.

2018-09-20 17:38:14	djohe|com3	that is not how clr works
2018-09-20 17:38:27	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Thanks for pointing that out.
2018-09-20 17:40:23	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> ah, i had a feeling something looked funny, all my messing around with the S1 disasm has proved useful ~~even if i broke the game a few times in the process~~
2018-09-20 17:41:04	djohe|com3	also no need for two tests or compares for the spike flag under Obj2E_ChkSpike:
2018-09-20 17:41:17	djohe|com3	one is enough
2018-09-20 17:43:14	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Oh I guess you're right ␤I could have done ␤https://gist.github.com/fa7281621c0c2a389af8eb362e4499ab#file-block0-.null
2018-09-20 17:43:42	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> And I think it might be faster too.
2018-09-20 17:43:43	djohe|com3	no just do the tst
2018-09-20 17:43:51	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Ah
2018-09-20 17:44:06	djohe|com3	        tst.b    ($FFFFXXXX).w ;Check if spike flag is inactive.

2018-09-20 17:44:27	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Oh I get it now.
2018-09-20 17:45:27	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I'd edit the guide again but, it's not broken, so I could leave it as is.
2018-09-20 17:45:42	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Nothing stopping you from cleaning it up
2018-09-20 17:45:55	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Well you got me there.
2018-09-20 17:46:07	djohe|com3	also instead of move.b    #$1,($FFFFXXXX).w ;Turn on spike flag I would do: st ($FFFFXXXX).w (smaller and faster)(check what st does yourself)
2018-09-20 17:47:52	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> is st and sf faster? I might start using them now, I don't typically bring them out regularly.
2018-09-20 17:47:53	djohe|com3	also I use moveq on sound/music ID's to d0
2018-09-20 17:48:34	djohe|com3	IIRC it is faster, atleast it is smaller
2018-09-20 17:48:43	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I haven't heard of st or sf. I'll need to play with them myself before I put them in the guide.
2018-09-20 17:48:53	djohe|com3	sf is basically same as clr.b
2018-09-20 17:49:01	djohe|com3	st sets it to $FF
2018-09-20 17:49:40	djohe|com3	imagine st being set and sf being a clear
2018-09-20 17:50:42	djohe|com3	also your guide says  jmp    (PlaySound).l
2018-09-20 17:50:44	djohe|com3	never do that
2018-09-20 17:50:54	djohe|com3	just write jmp PlaySound
2018-09-20 17:51:29	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> yeah, I always thought (<label>).l looked redundant
2018-09-20 17:51:39	djohe|com3	it wastes rom space
2018-09-20 17:51:40	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Interesting, thanks for teaching me this new command! ␤One last thing though... Would it be written like this?: ␤st   #$1,($FFFFXXXX).w ␤or just ␤st   ($FFFFXXX).w
2018-09-20 17:51:52	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> it needs no arguments
2018-09-20 17:51:59	djohe|com3	I clearly said "st ($FFFFXXXX).w"
2018-09-20 17:52:31	djohe|com3	st can only set something to $FF
2018-09-20 17:52:36	djohe|com3	not to #1
2018-09-20 17:52:41	djohe|com3	or any other value
2018-09-20 17:53:09	djohe|com3	[18:51:31] <+Dick-Cord> <P​acca> yeah, I always thought (<label>).l looked redundant
2018-09-20 17:53:10	djohe|com3	[18:51:40] <djohe|com3> it wastes rom space
2018-09-20 17:53:36	djohe|com3	if PlaySound label/routine is in ROM:00007FFE or lower 
2018-09-20 17:54:06	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> So... I should leave it as (PlaySound).l?
2018-09-20 17:54:10	djohe|com3	no
2018-09-20 17:54:19	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> That's fine.
2018-09-20 17:54:19	djohe|com3	never ever do that
2018-09-20 17:54:23	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Are you reading what djohe said :derpsonic:
2018-09-20 17:55:03	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> It looks like it's just a byproduct of the original rom, not something that should be used elsewhere
2018-09-20 17:55:09	%MainMemory	actually, in AS, leaving the .l/.w out can lead to additional passes
2018-09-20 17:55:20	djohe|com3	the only case is a stupid routine in Sonic2 for the SpecialCNZ bumpers
2018-09-20 17:55:22	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> ^
2018-09-20 17:55:35	%MainMemory	you should generally use .w first, and change it to .l if it tells you it's out of range
2018-09-20 17:55:51	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Well this is ASM68K ␤Not ASS
2018-09-20 17:55:53	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> That explains a lot! I don't actually care about extra passes though :derpsonic:
2018-09-20 17:55:54	%MainMemory	well, tbh you should probably try bra first
2018-09-20 17:56:06	%MainMemory	then jmp if bra.s and bra.w both don't work
2018-09-20 17:56:21	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> Doesn't asm68k just default to the largest possible jump size if you don't specify it?

2018-09-20 18:10:44	+Dick-Cord	<l​ion> what is the beq for tho

2018-09-20 18:10:58	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> backwards execute quantity
2018-09-20 18:11:10	djohe	hint you can not beq like that because it will not even reach that beq because of the jmp
2018-09-20 18:11:46	djohe	if you do not get it that is Iso Kilo
2018-09-20 18:11:48	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Ah, I see where I got the illegal error from using st on ($FFFFF5C0).w ␤... I forgot an F in the RAM address.
2018-09-20 18:12:34	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Anyways, I got that, so I'll remove that beq

2018-09-20 18:13:41	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> There are actually some odd moments in the final game where stuff like that does happen. It's likely that they were labeled though, since they were most likely just unused routines that didn't get wiped
2018-09-20 18:13:42	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> eww
2018-09-20 18:15:05	+Dick-Cord	*I​so Kilo* ~~And before anyone asks, I did change the checks from cmpi.b #$1,($FFFFXXXX).w to cmpi.b #$FF,($FFFFXXXX).w in places like SonicJump, Obj36Hurt and HurtSonic~~

2018-09-20 18:15:25	djohe|com3	you could just tst

2018-09-20 18:15:32	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> You should just use tst though
2018-09-20 18:15:33	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> lol
2018-09-20 18:15:47	djohe|com3	it is either 0 or FF
2018-09-20 18:15:48	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> also needs more bchg + beq and more moveq and more better code
2018-09-20 18:15:50	djohe|com3	so
2018-09-20 18:15:53	djohe|com3	just tst
2018-09-20 18:16:05	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> tst + bne is the same, but faster and simpler
2018-09-20 18:16:28	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> scc is also sexy
2018-09-20 18:16:40	+Dick-Cord	<l​ion> scc-sy if you will
2018-09-20 18:16:48	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> It's even more universal; if for some reason you wanted to store something other then 1 or $FF in that space, tst will still work
2018-09-20 18:17:17	djohe|com3	and for the record tst can work for more conditions then just 0 or something else
2018-09-20 18:17:17	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> tristate flags with tst is cool
2018-09-20 18:17:23	djohe|com3	^
2018-09-20 18:17:36	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> also fun thing I noticed the other day, like it just hit me
2018-09-20 18:17:46	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Sonic 1 uses beq and bpl/bmi for checking for floor collision
2018-09-20 18:17:55	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ...when they could just use bge and ble
2018-09-20 18:18:37	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> All I got out of that was that Pacca wanted a tst + bne.

2018-09-20 18:19:22	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> You should use beq if your checking for 0 there

2018-09-20 18:20:32	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> than sf and st

2018-09-20 18:27:20	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes
2018-09-20 18:27:37	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> there are some settings that make it not assemble
2018-09-20 18:27:52	%MainMemory	oh
2018-09-20 18:27:56	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I cant remember what you exactly have to do to make it not assembly
2018-09-20 18:28:04	%MainMemory	but they aren't enabled by default
2018-09-20 18:28:11	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but its most fun when you ignore warnings and it asembles it happily
2018-09-20 18:28:12	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> oops
2018-09-20 18:28:36	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> had many salt-filled hours debugging bugs like this
2018-09-20 18:28:57	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> on the other hand
2018-09-20 18:29:21	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I had many salt-filled hours debugging why moveq #224-1,dX actually makes the whole game crash
2018-09-20 18:29:33	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> because AS does not warn you at all for sign-extended values
2018-09-20 18:30:42	%MainMemory	so you're saying we need a new assembler
2018-09-20 18:31:07	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> *ASS
2018-09-20 18:31:10	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well having an option for it to choose whether to reject incorrectly sign-extended moveq instructions or not
2018-09-20 18:31:17	ValleyBell	Actually, if I would write "moveq #$E0-1,dX", I would expect it to just sign-extend it.
2018-09-20 18:31:57	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> you'd think that, but when you write that many times for, say, scanline table code, you tend to just forget
2018-09-20 18:32:07	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> So it assembled, but I don't doubt it'll crash or not load.
2018-09-20 18:32:22	djohe	it will play wrong sfx

2018-09-20 18:32:59	djohe	or that
2018-09-20 18:33:12	%MainMemory	well you could always grab the source code and modify it to warn about sign-extending moveq

2018-09-20 18:33:44	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> given the thing barely works and apparently the source is horrible

2018-09-20 18:35:37	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Oh
2018-09-20 18:36:28	ValleyBell	IMO you guys go way overboard with optimizations for a beginner's guide.
2018-09-20 18:36:34	djohe	no
2018-09-20 18:36:53	djohe	this is not even amazing optimizations
2018-09-20 18:37:03	djohe	this is standard code
2018-09-20 18:37:08	djohe	in my eyes
2018-09-20 18:37:08	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> this is quite simple stuff
2018-09-20 18:37:24	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like the first optimizationj tricks you find
2018-09-20 18:38:01	djohe	I hate looking at that stupid sonic1 like derpy code
2018-09-20 18:38:20	djohe	that looks so subpar
2018-09-20 18:38:33	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> mhmm
2018-09-20 18:38:39	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> And this is a hack made by a novice for beginners. ␤So yeah.
2018-09-20 18:38:40	ValleyBell	At first you learn how to code and then you start learing how to optimize. Not the other way round.
2018-09-20 18:38:41	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Sonic 1 and 2 code in general is just bad and lazy
2018-09-20 18:38:50	+Dick-Cord	<l​ion> what VB said tbh
2018-09-20 18:39:13	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> or, even better, you learn to code, and while you learn, you find optimization tricks
2018-09-20 18:39:14	djohe	so lion you like using a move.l when you could use a move.b then?
2018-09-20 18:39:28	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I'll keep the st's though.
2018-09-20 18:39:55	+Dick-Cord	<l​ion> no
2018-09-20 18:40:00	+Dick-Cord	<l​ion> calm the f down tbh
2018-09-20 18:40:01	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Some of these aren't just optimizations though, it's learning new instructions. tst, st, and sf in particular are good ones to learn
2018-09-20 18:40:16	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> i think the whole process tends to be a little trial and error, i guess
2018-09-20 18:40:28	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> one of the more cool and useful instructions are usually those you are too scared to learn
2018-09-20 18:40:30	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like subx
2018-09-20 18:40:31	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> prolly just me
2018-09-20 18:40:33	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and addx
2018-09-20 18:40:39	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> really cool and so rarely used
2018-09-20 18:40:48	djohe	I do not use those
2018-09-20 18:40:50	djohe	:P
2018-09-20 18:40:54	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> you should
2018-09-20 18:41:00	djohe	mabe I should
2018-09-20 18:41:00	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> add with carry is very useful
2018-09-20 18:41:02	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> I have not seen those in all my time looking at S1/S2/S3K code.
2018-09-20 18:41:22	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I believe there is no single addx in Sonic 1 to 3K
2018-09-20 18:41:28	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> I guess Sega was scared of them too :derpsonic:
2018-09-20 18:41:33	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I've used it like 3 times now, very helpful
2018-09-20 18:41:47	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> in Z80 code you see adc and sbc more often
2018-09-20 18:42:10	djohe	I hardly ever use sxx or advance instructions like those
2018-09-20 18:42:16	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> lol
2018-09-20 18:42:23	djohe	but then again I am not a pro programmer
2018-09-20 18:42:23	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> scc is another really helpful one
2018-09-20 18:42:31	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well you should be :V
2018-09-20 18:42:42	djohe	I do not program for a living

2018-09-20 18:44:21	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> negx could be cool as well, though I dont know in what kind of cases you could use negate with carry tho
2018-09-20 18:44:55	djohe	I do like to use "not" when I can tho
2018-09-20 18:44:58	djohe	:P

2018-09-20 18:45:27	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ...actually derp, you could totally use not instead of bchg to set or clear a flat

2018-09-20 18:50:11	djohe	it pissed me off by looking stupid unaligned when I wanted to horizontally loop it
2018-09-20 18:51:18	djohe	wanted 512 pixel PlaneA and 3 selection boxes side by side and then loop at the edges
2018-09-20 18:51:29	djohe	but it looked stupid unaligned
2018-09-20 18:52:58	djohe	I think people will get a seziure now instead because of the non looping flashing
2018-09-20 18:53:52	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Well thanks to today I learned a lot more commands, only 2 I learned what they actually did.
2018-09-20 18:54:13	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> same here, even if i won't likely use them
2018-09-20 18:54:49	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> come to think of it, i prefer level design more than messing with the code...

2018-09-20 19:38:03	ValleyBell	I don't think I used "st" a lot. I usually went with "moveq -1" or just bset. (Because why should I waste a full byte for one flag.)
2018-09-20 19:38:38	djohe|com3	good luck doing a moveq on a ram addr
2018-09-20 19:39:06	ValleyBell	For bitfields and flags I always used bset.
2018-09-20 19:40:16	ValleyBell	The only time I remember "st" being really useful was doing a 68000 ASM version of this: d0 = (condition) ? 3 : 5;
2018-09-20 19:41:44	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Quackshot uses them for just about every flag it has, which I find odd because some would be much better suited to bitfields
2018-09-20 19:42:58	djohe|com3	I only use st when I do not need more then like on or off or tri state
2018-09-20 19:43:58	djohe|com3	and even then I use alot of subq instead
2018-09-20 19:44:55	+Dick-Cord	*o​Wo* Has changed nick to S​everal People
2018-09-20 19:47:15	+Dick-Cord	*S​everal People* Has changed nick to G​4
2018-09-20 19:48:33	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> The most obvious case in Quackshot where it feels wasteful is the inventory system. It uses a separate flag for each item which is simple a has it/doesn't have it flag, which could easily have been set up in bitfields
2018-09-20 19:49:05	djohe|com3	that is stupid yes
2018-09-20 19:50:26	djohe|com3	but did they have alot of free ram
2018-09-20 19:51:13	ValleyBell	If they had RAM to spare, using full bytes is easier and faster.
2018-09-20 19:51:17	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> I haven't found a lot free up to now, but the odd few bytes here or there

2018-09-21 13:37:27	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> That's not really the point though.
2018-09-21 13:38:45	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Sony in Microshaft's online services certainly aren't perfect, but they are way better by comparison.
2018-09-21 13:40:34	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Switch owners deserve better, especially with where the subscription prices stand.

2018-09-21 23:38:46	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> @Iso Kilo Sonic Boom can't be a good sonic game, foundationally
2018-09-21 23:38:56	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> It plays like Lego Star wars
2018-09-21 23:39:18	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> The best you can do is a stage port to either unreal or hedgehog engines
2018-09-21 23:39:57	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> Let bad ideas stay bad
2018-09-21 23:40:48	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Admittedly, some people might like that gameplay, provided the game wasn't filled with shitty programming errors
2018-09-21 23:41:12	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> Yeah, I didn't say it's a foundationally bad game
2018-09-21 23:41:20	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> Just a fundamentally bad sonic game
2018-09-21 23:41:33	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> It's the goddamn slowest garbage ever
2018-09-21 23:42:09	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> It's more like a spin off then anything. I have no clue why Sega thought it was a good idea to rebrand themselves with it though :thonk:
2018-09-21 23:42:23	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> I know precisely why
2018-09-21 23:42:39	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> They were capitalizing on the success of Skylanders
2018-09-21 23:43:24	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> Giving their IP a makeover to appeal to the garbage modern stylistic tends you see in 3d animation and kid games
2018-09-21 23:43:59	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> When will Sega and Nintendo realize that modern kids only play FPS games :derpsonic:
2018-09-21 23:44:07	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> Or Minecraft
2018-09-21 23:44:47	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Yeah, if you want kids to play your Mario or Sonic game these days, you actually have to make a solid game first, without pandering
2018-09-21 23:44:49	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> But really it was that, I'm just glad they didn't go full stop happy meal mascot design with the characters
2018-09-21 23:45:05	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> Their biggest mistake was outsourcing development
2018-09-21 23:45:32	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> And using cryengine on an incapable platform
2018-09-21 23:45:50	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> Which BRB had to port by hand
2018-09-21 23:46:13	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> That's the fault of the 2014 exclusivity deal with Nintendo
2018-09-21 23:46:17	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> That sounds like a waste of precious time :derpsonic:
2018-09-21 23:46:26	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> It was supposed to be a PC game
2018-09-21 23:46:39	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> But Sega had nothing to show Nintendo at the time of the deal
2018-09-21 23:46:53	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Wow. What a train wreck
2018-09-21 23:47:49	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> The gameplay style could have worked too if it was actually fast
2018-09-21 23:48:10	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> But instead it's just some Lego licensed game garbage
2018-09-21 23:48:28	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> And while I think Lego Star wars etc can be fine games
2018-09-21 23:48:34	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> They're not sonic at all
2018-09-21 23:49:16	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> It was a passionless project developed by tired and overworked people who hated the game they made
2018-09-21 23:49:31	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> And nothing good cab ever come of that
2018-09-21 23:49:43	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Sounds pretty much like Sega for the past decade or so
2018-09-21 23:50:00	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> They could have done a much better job of it themselves
2018-09-21 23:50:29	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> They hired rookies and people who got where they are by making crash bandicoot
2018-09-21 23:50:47	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> 20 years ago
2018-09-21 23:51:51	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> The best thing to come out of this whole ordeal was the show, which is nothing short of a work of art
2018-09-21 23:52:31	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Yeah, I've heard pretty good things about it. I heard it was even self aware about the demise of it's playable counterpart
2018-09-21 23:53:09	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> Oh yeah, it's memetastic, and very in touch with the current state of things

2018-09-23 13:34:56	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I was kinda hoping I could just have Sonic 2's layout drawer skip the first $88 bytes in a S3K level file but I don't think I can. Definitely over my head but I'm having fun at least.
2018-09-23 13:36:00	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> To start with S3K seems to have a level loading routine unique to each act...or atleast a lot of acts. But I think S2 only has the one.
2018-09-23 13:37:25	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Pretty sure I'm better off trying to modify S2's code than trying to rip the whole thing out and do it S3K's way though.
2018-09-23 13:38:03	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Yeah, S3&K does level loading & rendering in a significantly different way due to the new level format.
2018-09-23 13:38:09	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Also...
2018-09-23 13:38:28	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> > They're good for eatin' and not much else. ␤ ␤Hey now, don't sell 'em short. Where I come from, they're good for shooting at too.
2018-09-23 13:38:45	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> :vv:
2018-09-23 13:38:55	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> That's not personally my cup of tea though.
2018-09-23 13:39:52	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Anyway, what is it that you're trying to accomplish? Larger levels?
2018-09-23 13:40:03	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> In a nutshell yea.
2018-09-23 13:40:14	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Oh.
2018-09-23 13:40:59	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I'm going for broke and I'm remaking Sonic Advance. I'm going to call it....wait for it......
2018-09-23 13:41:00	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Sonic Retreat
2018-09-23 13:41:01	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Boom.
2018-09-23 13:41:55	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> But I need larger levels to faithfully recreate the majority of the level maps.
2018-09-23 13:45:30	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Something interesting (to me) that happened: I replaced the binclude for EHZ1's layout with the one converted to S3K format and nothing else and it was almost fine. Sonic and Tails showed up, and there was one chunk visible on screen and the rest was garbled.
2018-09-23 13:46:32	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> The startpos seemed screwed cause they just fell to their deaths. I commented out the decompression line after the line that moves the layout data to RAM (since S3K layout data isnt compressed) and it got even more garbled. Also Sonic and Tails never loaded.
2018-09-23 13:47:08	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Why not just port Saxman's level format from the "Saxman's Sonic Boom" engine to your disassembly? It's level format theoretically allows for much larger levels than S3&K and he even included tools to convert S2 to the new format.
2018-09-23 13:47:32	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I didn't know it existed, that's why :vv:
2018-09-23 13:47:38	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Ah.
2018-09-23 13:47:56	djohe|OUT	Aerosol you know you can just have uncompressed level layouts in ROM and have them being huge
2018-09-23 13:48:15	djohe|OUT	and just minimal modifications to the code
2018-09-23 13:48:23	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> That too
2018-09-23 13:48:27	djohe|OUT	sure it will bloat ROM but whatever
2018-09-23 13:48:58	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I didn't, but I want to do things the right way. Well, as right as I can manage. I'd like it to work on hardware at some point.
2018-09-23 13:49:18	djohe|OUT	and so would uncompressed level layouts...
2018-09-23 13:49:38	djohe|OUT	you can make it work S3K way later
2018-09-23 13:50:48	djohe|OUT	and for reference each level layout for the Foreground uncompressed = 2kbytes in unmodified Sonic2
2018-09-23 13:51:08	djohe|OUT	derp might be 4
2018-09-23 13:51:12	djohe|OUT	I forgot
2018-09-23 13:51:26	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Uncompressed level layouts simply limit the space available for other things, but not by very much.
2018-09-23 13:51:42	djohe|OUT	ROM space is plentiful
2018-09-23 13:52:05	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Given what you're trying to attempt, it should definitely be well under 4MB
2018-09-23 13:52:24	djohe|OUT	and yes it was 2k for unmodified S2
2018-09-23 13:52:30	djohe|OUT	for foreground
2018-09-23 13:52:49	djohe|OUT	and background can be trimmed for many levels
2018-09-23 13:53:20	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I suppose that's an option then but doesn't Sonic 2's level format have an inherent limit on size, regardless of whether the data is compressed or not?
2018-09-23 13:53:33	djohe|OUT	just modify that code :P
2018-09-23 13:53:50	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> ^
2018-09-23 13:54:17	djohe|OUT	the level size is max #$4000 horizontally and #$800 vertically but is easily modified
2018-09-23 13:54:38	djohe|OUT	if I can do it so can you
2018-09-23 13:54:39	djohe|OUT	:P
2018-09-23 13:55:05	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Youse a funny guy!
2018-09-23 13:55:06	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> The beauty of programming is that if you don't like the way something works, you can just change it.
2018-09-23 13:55:54	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> ...Assuming you have the code. That part is pretty important
2018-09-23 13:56:12	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> There's always a catch
2018-09-23 13:56:13	djohe|OUT	at some point in the future I am going to make foreground level layout loading separate from background level loading so I can share backgrounds for several levels
2018-09-23 13:56:30	djohe|OUT	the only catch is ROM space being lil bloated
2018-09-23 13:56:49	djohe|OUT	and you needing to know how to code
2018-09-23 13:56:55	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I don't mind doing things the hard way though. There are much harder parts of this project I'll have to tackle.
2018-09-23 13:57:29	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Better I learn how shit works properly now rather than go for a quick return.
2018-09-23 13:57:39	djohe|OUT	seriously just making Sonic2 use fixed size of like #$8000 x #$800 is not even hard
2018-09-23 13:58:07	djohe|OUT	just deinterlace that stupid level layout format first :P
2018-09-23 13:59:09	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Starting small is important to the flow of any project though, especially if you're just learning. You'll overwhelm yourself if you get too ambitious and try to tackle massive pillars early on.
2018-09-23 13:59:18	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Once I understand exactly what Sonic 2 is doing when it loads levels I don't think I'll have that much trouble making it work with S3K format files anyway. Or Sonic Boom format or I'm Lazy So I'll Just Decompress Everything format.
2018-09-23 14:01:43	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> If I really wanted to overwhelm myself I'd still be trying to make 2048 for Genesis. Phew.
2018-09-23 14:01:51	djohe|OUT	do note if you do modify vertical size you also need to modify a ton of routines that is set a fixed value
2018-09-23 14:02:06	djohe|OUT	oerg866 already did that
2018-09-23 14:02:09	djohe|OUT	:P
2018-09-23 14:03:08	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I was going to for my own learning benefit.
2018-09-23 14:03:54	djohe|OUT	looks like I have support for vertical sizes of #$400,#$800,#$1000 in my hack (vertical level wrap/loop)
2018-09-23 14:05:29	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Is there a singular subroutine that parses the data passed into RAM? That's what I've been looking for
2018-09-23 14:05:50	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> closest I've come to finding something like that is the drawinitialbg routine
2018-09-23 14:06:25	djohe|OUT	have you considered searching for looking where it loads level layout RAM addr into aX
2018-09-23 14:07:06	djohe|OUT	one for displaying and one for collision
2018-09-23 14:08:07	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I have, that's how I came upon drawinitialbg
2018-09-23 14:08:54	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> loadlevellayout basically hands the compressed data to the kosinski decompressor, which does it's thing and then returns to subroutine
2018-09-23 14:09:15	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> which is...loadzoneblocks if i recall. The next subroutine it executes is drawinitialbg
2018-09-23 14:09:43	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> which...kinda looks like it's reading the RAM addresses from the offset it's been handed to draw tiles.
2018-09-23 14:10:57	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Cause after that's done it "converts the collision array", loads collision indices, resets the controls and clears the level started flag.
2018-09-23 14:12:09	djohe|OUT	again that is only for the level loading.... you want the two that runs every time the game requests block update and when player objects collision requests blocks for collision
2018-09-23 14:12:15	djohe|OUT	it is not even hard to find
2018-09-23 14:12:44	djohe|OUT	easiest one to find is the one for collision
2018-09-23 14:12:56	djohe|OUT	then the drawing one is very similar but in another place
2018-09-23 14:14:30	djohe|OUT	[15:07:10] <djohe|OUT> have you considered searching for looking where it loads level layout RAM addr into aX
2018-09-23 14:14:38	djohe|OUT	applies to atleast the collision one
2018-09-23 14:15:26	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> so i'm looking for somewhere else where it says "lea    (Level_Layout).w,aX" then
2018-09-23 14:15:37	djohe|OUT	JUST DO IT
2018-09-23 14:15:46	djohe|OUT	I am not giving more hints
2018-09-23 14:16:27	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Well the thing i found something like that before, but I didn't think it was relevant.
2018-09-23 14:17:08	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Specifically cause it looked like it was collision stuff which wasn't what I was after at the time.
2018-09-23 14:17:10	djohe|OUT	how can it not be relevant when the player object needs to interact with blocks and that blocks is a part of chunks that is a part of level layout
2018-09-23 14:17:40	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I figured if I get it looking right first, I can get it acting right after.
2018-09-23 14:18:02	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> if Sonic fell through the level so be it, least I knew I was on the right track.
2018-09-23 14:18:11	<--	ShaddixCroft (Kroft@bdnk-7756f346.range86-151.btcentralplus.com) has quit (Connection closed)
2018-09-23 14:18:17	djohe|OUT	hint that involves finding said code and both drawing and collision routine is similar
2018-09-23 14:18:26	djohe|OUT	so if you find one you can easily find the other one
2018-09-23 14:19:09	djohe|OUT	ohh wait I said I was not handing out more hints
2018-09-23 14:19:14	djohe|OUT	please unsee that hint
2018-09-23 14:19:31	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I had seen it earlier before you'd said anything. And you'd already said that, so it doesn't count.
2018-09-23 14:20:02	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> The code I had seen and disregarded was in Find_Tile: anyway
2018-09-23 14:24:23	djohe|OUT	lol for whatever stupid reason my changelog related to this still says: "Beware Metropolis Act3 is probably broken"
2018-09-23 14:24:42	djohe|OUT	gg at me not changing changelog properly
2018-09-23 14:26:36	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> lol
2018-09-23 14:29:11	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> move.w    #bytesToLcnt(LevelLayoutEnd-LevelLayout),d1
2018-09-23 14:29:27	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I can't read that as anything but a strange reference to female genitalia.
2018-09-23 14:29:43	djohe|OUT	go compare it to an older disassembly then
2018-09-23 14:29:48	djohe|OUT	???
2018-09-23 14:29:50	djohe|OUT	PROFIT
2018-09-23 14:29:56	djohe|OUT	or read the macro code
2018-09-23 14:30:12	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> those macros are so useless
2018-09-23 14:30:19	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Well I can see what it's doing. I just have no idea what Lcnt is supposed to say.
2018-09-23 14:30:20	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its super hard to divide by 4 and substract 1
2018-09-23 14:30:34	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> L count
2018-09-23 14:30:37	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> long count
2018-09-23 14:30:41	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> stupidity
2018-09-23 14:32:23	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Huh. Ok. long count. Makes sense.
2018-09-23 14:42:05	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Oh snap. I'm even more of an idiot than I thought I was.
2018-09-23 14:42:49	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Not directly related to what I'm doing right now but....are all offsets done like the SP is?
2018-09-23 14:43:02	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Like...backwards?
2018-09-23 14:47:54	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> offsets as in..?
2018-09-23 14:54:09	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Like say you have $B600+1, that's $B601 right? Not $B5FF?
2018-09-23 14:54:32	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Cause it seems like the SP goes backwards
2018-09-23 14:56:08	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well depends what you mean with backwards really
2018-09-23 14:56:32	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its pretty common that pushing things to stack makes it decrements and poppoing things out makes it increment
2018-09-23 14:57:43	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> well, move.b #$FF, -(sp) would put $FF at $B5FF if for some reason the SP were set to $B600 right?
2018-09-23 14:58:00	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> So it's only the sp you have to treat like this?
2018-09-23 14:58:21	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well really any address registers would work the same way, if you use the pre-decrement mode
2018-09-23 14:58:54	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> but the sp is the only one you HAVE to use like this, is what I'm asking.
2018-09-23 14:59:08	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I know the sp and a7 are the same thing
2018-09-23 14:59:34	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well the only reason really, is because the CPU works like this when you use like rts or jsr instruction
2018-09-23 15:00:55	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Ok. Alright so I don't have to change my understanding of anything else. Back to looking for the right routine then.
2018-09-23 15:01:29	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> There's only so many places that the RAM address of the layout is moved to a register, but some of the routines aren't labelled so I have to figure out what they do.
2018-09-23 15:01:46	djohe|OUT	ok here is a hint
2018-09-23 15:01:58	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its possible to know what iut all means, its just not obvious
2018-09-23 15:02:03	djohe|OUT	look for a routine with 7F0 or whatever that collision routine has
2018-09-23 15:02:17	djohe|OUT	780 or whatever
2018-09-23 15:02:22	djohe|OUT	I can not remember
2018-09-23 15:02:57	djohe|OUT	again the routine is very similar to the collision routine
2018-09-23 15:03:47	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> lea and movea.l are equivalent aren't they?
2018-09-23 15:04:01	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> not always
2018-09-23 15:04:09	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> it depends on the ea mode
2018-09-23 15:04:21	djohe|OUT	dude.... there is only so many routines that use like that move some obscure value to dx
2018-09-23 15:04:26	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like for ex lea 4(a1),a1 just adds 4 to a1
2018-09-23 15:04:49	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but movea.l 4(a1),a1 will read long from a1+4 into a1
2018-09-23 15:05:01	djohe|OUT	it is not rocket science to look for routines using obscure values like the one in the collision routine
2018-09-23 15:05:35	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> no not at all. Unless I wanted to make it rocket science with that annoying script, whatever it was called.
2018-09-23 15:08:08	djohe|OUT	if you read the collision routine you can clearly see there is a rather obscure move.w a big value to a data reg
2018-09-23 15:08:16	djohe|OUT	derp
2018-09-23 15:08:20	djohe|OUT	I meant andi.w
2018-09-23 15:09:23	djohe|OUT	just search for that big value in the rest of the disassembly and you should get 2 results (one being for an unused routine (CPZ 2P VS)
2018-09-23 15:10:06	djohe|OUT	and the other one is for the draw block routine used by all levels
2018-09-23 15:11:34	djohe|OUT	actually 4 results but anyone could tell S2SS code from other code and anyone could see that one result is for oil slide chunk checking
2018-09-23 15:12:31	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Huh. DrawBlockCol then.
2018-09-23 15:13:04	djohe|OUT	this is basic put one and one together......... it is not rocket science.... if collision routine does something so should the oil slide and the draw one do too
2018-09-23 15:13:34	djohe|OUT	and congratulations
2018-09-23 15:13:46	djohe|OUT	>_> you should not have needed help to find this seriously
2018-09-23 15:14:12	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I'll swallow a bottle of pills later
2018-09-23 15:17:36	djohe|OUT	I have no idea wtf how your search methods or whatever you were doing but your thinking and logic seems to be flawed
2018-09-23 15:17:51	djohe|OUT	before you finally found it thanks to my hint
2018-09-23 15:18:46	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I'll make sure to credit you and only you :vv:
2018-09-23 15:19:00	djohe|OUT	because if you look at the collision routine and draw routine they are "EXTREMLY SIMILAR"
2018-09-23 15:20:14	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Yes yes
2018-09-23 15:20:48	djohe|OUT	and when you come across things that look very obscure like andi.w	#$F00,dX a light should come up in your head to look for that
2018-09-23 15:21:15	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> And had I come across it, that light bulb might have!
2018-09-23 15:22:01	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Same way I've found plenty other things in fact
2018-09-23 15:22:24	djohe|OUT	[16:22:00] <+Dick-Cord> <A​erosol> And had I come across it, that light bulb might have!
2018-09-23 15:22:27	djohe|OUT	wat...
2018-09-23 15:22:34	djohe|OUT	it was right there in the collision one
2018-09-23 15:22:47	djohe|OUT	do not tell me they changed it in later disassembly
2018-09-23 15:22:50	djohe|OUT	to a macro
2018-09-23 15:24:01	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Again, the "collision routine" I came across was Find_Tile:
2018-09-23 15:24:24	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> there are no obscure values in Find_Tile, so I kept looking.
2018-09-23 15:24:45	djohe|OUT	I have no idea what that one is.... look at old label in comments
2018-09-23 15:25:15	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> It's called from the main collision routine at some point.
2018-09-23 15:25:58	djohe|OUT	my disassembly clearly says

2018-09-23 16:23:32	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Don't hold your breath for Sonic Retreat, it's just a cool pipe dream of mine.
2018-09-23 16:24:41	+Dick-Cord	<l​ion> try starting with easier projects first to get your bearings
2018-09-23 16:25:07	%MainMemory	getting the art to look good is going to be immensely difficult
2018-09-23 16:26:17	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> well I know all about pipe dreams, and they don't usually work out by jumping right in
2018-09-23 16:26:25	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> But if you're confident in your abilities, then go for it
2018-09-23 16:26:27	%MainMemory	you're going from a system that has 16 palettes each for backgrounds and sprites, to a system that has 4 palettes, not to mention the reduced color depth
2018-09-23 16:26:48	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I'm not. The point isn't to be confident the point is to break shit and figure it out as I go until I get bored.
2018-09-23 16:27:23	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> And yes, the gba has a lot more colours than the genesis. It also has Mode7, which the genesis does not, and hardware sprite scaling and rotation (i think).
2018-09-23 16:28:00	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I don't even know how I'm going to manage the water slide in the first fucking level buuuuut i don't care. It'll be fun.
2018-09-23 16:28:06	%MainMemory	you don't really need sprite scaling and rotation

2018-09-23 16:28:16	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I do for the special stage.
2018-09-23 16:28:48	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Yes, I know that's basically writing a new game mode from scratch.
2018-09-23 16:29:11	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> No, I don't think I can do it. And no, I don't care either :vv:
2018-09-23 16:29:24	%MainMemory	there's probably some way you could hack up the sonic 2 special stage to get something like advance's
2018-09-23 16:29:49	%MainMemory	better ask flamewing
2018-09-23 16:30:28	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Proooooobably. If and when I get that far I'll drop him a line. For right now I'll be content figuring out how Sonic 2 loads its levels so I can properly play with it.
2018-09-23 16:33:13	+Dick-Cord	<G​abriel the flying shark> ~~isn't clownacy making a c port of sonic 2 which would be easier to hack ?~~
2018-09-23 16:33:45	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> If Xenowhirl was able to get the Sonic Advance 3 special stage into his Yoshi in Sonic 2 hack with sprite scaling of a similar quality to the GBA damn near 7 years ago, then it should be possible to recreate the much simpler Sonic Advance 1 special stages.
2018-09-23 16:34:26	%MainMemory	...was it 7 years ago?
2018-09-23 16:34:26	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I had to think for a second what the Sadv3 special stage was. I mean I know it's possible, I've seen the StarFox "port". It's just way out of my league.

2018-09-23 16:42:09	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Oh wait, I know how he did that in his hack
2018-09-23 16:42:32	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> That looks similar to the psuedo-3D method in Road Rash

2018-09-23 16:43:21	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> But probably simplified since there's no need to deal with turns or varying terrain.
2018-09-23 16:44:17	%MainMemory	that's not exactly the effect you need for your hack

2018-09-23 16:54:46	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I don't strictly have to for what I need (bigger levels) but now I just want to understand how it works.

2018-09-23 16:58:13	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Sonic 2's Kosinski Decompression routines will work with the files I have already then? I used LevelConverter to convert them.
2018-09-23 16:58:40	%MainMemory	all you needed to do was decompress and recompress the files
2018-09-23 16:58:54	%MainMemory	but LevelConverter will do that as part of its operation
2018-09-23 16:59:05	+Dick-Cord	<m​aple t> So if I read all that correctly, you want bigger levels? But what for?

2018-09-23 17:40:12	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> Or what uses it?
2018-09-23 17:40:44	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> ok. above my head but doesn't seem like I need to know why the code is moving that value to the sr before jumping to drawinitialbg, and then moving #$2300 after
2018-09-23 17:41:01	%MainMemory	to disable interrupts
2018-09-23 17:41:12	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> er DrawBlockRow rather
2018-09-23 17:41:41	%MainMemory	the last thing you want is the VDP triggering a HInt/VInt while you're trying to draw graphics
2018-09-23 17:41:42	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Well I know that's the purpose, but I don't know why that value specifically.
2018-09-23 17:42:04	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> DOS/V has the ability to use special PS/55 video modes, or rather, regular VGA instead if it can't find them, but I don't recall about anything with the TeraDrive.
2018-09-23 17:44:24	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> the $2000 is for having the privilege levels to do many instructions (especially to SR), and $700 is for the interrupt mask, masking out the interrupt levels up to 7
2018-09-23 17:44:25	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and I think including 7
2018-09-23 17:44:28	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> while $2300 is only to level 3
2018-09-23 17:44:33	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> effectively it just masks out h-int and v-int
2018-09-23 17:45:15	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I'll save that somewhere, that's useful info
2018-09-23 17:45:50	%MainMemory	generally you want to disable those interrupts any time you're writing to VRAM
2018-09-23 17:46:23	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> MainMemory does the level converter also add the 64-byte pointer list and 8-byte header? I'm assuming yes?
2018-09-23 17:46:56	%MainMemory	if it didn't, then it wouldn't really be converting it to S3K format, would it?
2018-09-23 17:47:45	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Only reason I'm asking is cause you said something like "all you have to do is decompress and recompress, but level converter does some other things too"
2018-09-23 17:48:00	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I should sometime write an optimizer for the layout data
2018-09-23 17:48:12	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> you could get some really good optimizations out of the weird format
2018-09-23 17:48:30	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Just making sure I hadn't misunderstood something.
2018-09-23 17:49:17	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> SR is system byte and CCR.
2018-09-23 17:49:19	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> wat
2018-09-23 17:49:21	%MainMemory	I was talking about the tiles
2018-09-23 17:50:05	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> Upper byte is the "system control" area, where you can mask interrupts and grant privileges, and lower byte is the CCR.
2018-09-23 17:50:37	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its called a status register and it really only contains a handful of flags that change how the CPU works
2018-09-23 17:51:55	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Right ok.
2018-09-23 17:52:22	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> ...yes, the name is very obvious.
2018-09-23 17:53:14	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> That being said, being able to control the system area and the CCR at the same time through a word move is good for saving a few bytes.
2018-09-23 17:53:51	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes because you usually manually input a value into SR
2018-09-23 17:54:41	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> really the ronly reason I could see you doing that is to set the X flag and then like addx or subx register into another
2018-09-23 17:54:47	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> which in case I guess but its not terribly common
2018-09-23 17:54:49	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Oh, I've just discovered another small niggle. It'll probably work out fine in the end though.
2018-09-23 17:55:06	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> the converter spits out files for the acts seperately, but Sonic 2 doesn't do things that way.
2018-09-23 17:55:53	%MainMemory	you can make it do things that way
2018-09-23 17:56:19	%MainMemory	or if the files have the same data then it doesn't matteer
2018-09-23 17:56:23	%MainMemory	*matter

2018-09-23 17:57:39	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> Or hell, let's port NetBSD!
2018-09-23 17:57:42	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Yea that's what I thought. Sonic 2's data doesn't really change between acts like Sonic 3's does.

2018-09-23 17:58:07	%MainMemory	all you need is the layout file
2018-09-23 17:58:19	%MainMemory	everything else will be literally identical
2018-09-23 17:58:48	%MainMemory	well unless you're using the s3k object manager or ring manager
2018-09-23 18:00:14	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Right, ok.
2018-09-23 18:00:36	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I mean is the format identical after you get past the header and pointer list?
2018-09-23 18:00:53	%MainMemory	uh
2018-09-23 18:00:54	%MainMemory	no
2018-09-23 18:01:13	%MainMemory	S3K is variable size, S2 is fixed size
2018-09-23 18:02:14	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Alright. I'm hung up here then. After the pointer list and header, each line in S3K format describes both FG and BG data?
2018-09-23 18:02:33	%MainMemory	no

2018-09-23 18:05:34	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I see, ok
2018-09-23 18:09:16	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> I'll have a look and see how S3 does it if I can then.
2018-09-23 18:09:40	%MainMemory	that would be a good idea
2018-09-23 18:15:24	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> Yea it's just a lot harder to read.
2018-09-23 18:23:13	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> At least it's a named constant. I can just have a look and see what happens to it when named in every spot i find it in
2018-09-23 18:35:12	+Dick-Cord	<A​erosol> There is so much level-specific crap.

2018-09-24 17:12:53	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I cant even remember the name
2018-09-24 17:13:18	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> or it could also be from Iso Kilo seeming from his/her/their message
2018-09-24 17:13:50	-->	ShaddixCroft (Kroft@bdnk-7756f346.range86-151.btcentralplus.com) has joined #SSRG
2018-09-24 17:20:14	+Dick-Cord	<M​isinko> Nah, Iso usually asks her questions in a public space
2018-09-24 17:20:30	+Dick-Cord	<M​isinko> So I doubt EK is really pestered by it
2018-09-24 17:20:36	+Dick-Cord	<M​isinko> Or, Trox
2018-09-24 17:20:38	+Dick-Cord	<M​isinko> I'm dumb
2018-09-24 17:21:25	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Maybe. I'm really not involved on this situation. Especially because I'm currently working alone in my hack. We worked together a couple of times and I in fact did some dramas sometimes, but since I returned as a member in SSRG I promised to myself I was never going to make a new fuss and I will not. When I was banned I did read everything that Stephen, Ordos, Spann and others said about that situation and I took every
2018-09-24 17:21:26	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218>  word as a reflection to not to make new scandals. Mainly because this community is where my project was born from and I felt I would really have to respect everyone it doesn't matter the circumstance. I don't have to do with the situation this time and even if I had, I'd not give a fuck because the current EK puts the friendships in the first place.
2018-09-24 17:22:45	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Although it's normal for the people to think I'd be involved due to the huge number of times I was involved in similar situations in the past, so I understand it.
2018-09-24 17:24:10	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> nobody can escape life without being misunderstood, or being characterized some way you try not to be
2018-09-24 17:28:18	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> the only solution is to enter any social environ with the understanding that you're not there to be liked
2018-09-24 17:28:44	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> >_>
2018-09-24 17:28:52	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> gee you are helpful
2018-09-24 17:29:01	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> ye
2018-09-24 17:34:26	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> yep, the truth is a cruel bitch
2018-09-24 17:47:55	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> ...
2018-09-24 17:48:59	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> I think FireRat's post has successfully melted my brain...
2018-09-24 17:50:57	+Dick-Cord	<o​erg866> O.o what am I reading
2018-09-24 17:53:15	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Natsumi pretty much countered every main point that FireRat brought up, but what mainly confuses is this excerpt:
2018-09-24 17:53:26	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> ...Besides that, and here comes my darkest secret, today I'm physically 22 years old, but for some reason I still mentally feel like I was 13 years old. Understand the implication? Lobotomy may want to kill and destroy me now. I don't want problems though, just develop my stuff with the best of my "human being" quality, plus some more, or I'd not be myself. ␤ ␤My actual problem though are the manipulations. You
2018-09-24 17:53:27	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> r common belief on people like me says the exact opposite from the truth. I don't manipulate sexual targets for my own desire...
2018-09-24 17:56:59	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> @oerg866 I'm asking the same to myself, dude.
2018-09-24 17:57:58	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> I'm sat here thinking to myself: "No, FireRat, I don't fully understand the implication. Are you saying that you feel as though you are developmentally behind? If so, what in God's names does that have to do with sexual manipulation and exploitation? And why the hell do you think Lobotomy of all people would give enough of a shit about you to end your life?"
2018-09-24 17:58:19	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> people tend to feel younger than they actually are all the time
2018-09-24 17:58:22	+Dick-Cord	<o​erg866> What the fuck
2018-09-24 17:58:29	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> doesn't automatically make you a pedophile
2018-09-24 17:58:37	+Dick-Cord	<o​erg866> I'll just close this tab and come back in a few hours
2018-09-24 17:58:39	+Dick-Cord	<o​erg866> Lmao
2018-09-24 17:58:42	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> So I've just read through that thread. I think I need to invest in a gun
2018-09-24 17:58:44	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I like pretending I am younger than I am, but it doesnt mean I am actually retarded...
2018-09-24 17:58:52	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and I dont think he really knows what he is saying there..?
2018-09-24 17:59:06	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Stephen pls come with one in here too
2018-09-24 17:59:14	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I need a gun but I am too afraid to hold one
2018-09-24 17:59:26	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> I just think that the community members (ehr, us at all) are caring too much.
2018-09-24 17:59:38	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Honestly, I read a few paragraphs more than once and still struggled to understand his point
2018-09-24 17:59:42	+Dick-Cord	<G​4> I predicted this reaction
2018-09-24 18:00:35	+Dick-Cord	<G​4> I fully understood what firerat’s points are

2018-09-24 18:00:44	+Dick-Cord	<G​4> Because I have been there
2018-09-24 18:00:52	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Stephen read my post for some actual context on what the hell he is even sayin
2018-09-24 18:00:59	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> it might help... Maybe
2018-09-24 18:01:10	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Yeah I read that, but all it made me wonder is where this shit has even come from
2018-09-24 18:01:15	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> I'm not telling you guys to just to avoid the situation, but it's very bad to see the community being known for the newcomers for the fights instead of being known for their hacking products
2018-09-24 18:01:47	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> I don't know the source of this situation, though
2018-09-24 18:02:32	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Apparently SonLVL has been flagged as three separate malwares by Windows Defender :derpsonic:
2018-09-24 18:02:36	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> The problem with the community is it has become too well known and popular so people walk in thinking they're the big shit when the reality is they're at the bottom of the pile. That results in people getting fed up with their "do it for me" attitude, they get whiny, the community gets a bad name and so it goes on
2018-09-24 18:03:15	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Back when it was more of a niche area, people who took it up knew exactly what they were getting into so it was less frustrating
2018-09-24 18:04:16	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ^
2018-09-24 18:04:17	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> that too
2018-09-24 18:04:21	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Yes
2018-09-24 18:04:25	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> indeed
2018-09-24 18:04:33	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its a very unfortunate state of affairs, and many people think its a toxic mess
2018-09-24 18:04:45	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but really, being here for a long time, I dont feel like it is
2018-09-24 18:05:09	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> then again people like djohe or me may add to that feeling a little :V
2018-09-24 18:05:13	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> It's the main reason SSRG will be shifting focus soon, to make it more accessible to beginners and hopefully give people the motivation to learn and not become reliant
2018-09-24 18:05:26	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its quite frustrating when even people you know well for long time feel this way and want to quit too
2018-09-24 18:05:31	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but its like, how would you solve this?
2018-09-24 18:05:40	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yea
2018-09-24 18:06:25	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> The problem is the bar was quickly raised by disassemblies, but people who missed out on the times when they became mainstream now find decent documentation hard to come by, and so they are immediately put off
2018-09-24 18:06:31	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Yeah. I dunno if the romhacking was changed too much for the romhackers to treat their hacks as a products instead of treating them as a fun time to put the free time on it.
2018-09-24 18:06:45	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes, not enough documentation is very bad
2018-09-24 18:06:51	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> that is the main issue in here imo
2018-09-24 18:06:57	%MainMemory	speaking of documentation https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/
2018-09-24 18:06:57	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Romhacking wasn't meant to be fun?
2018-09-24 18:06:58	%ChaosGamma	Title: What nobody tells you about documentation - Blog - Divio
2018-09-24 18:07:03	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but yet, it takes time and effort to make documentation
2018-09-24 18:07:11	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yet we cant seem to band together for the greater good
2018-09-24 18:07:20	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its very sad state of affairs actualyl
2018-09-24 18:07:32	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> One thing I've found with 68K guides, Markeys included, is that while they're great for understanding the commands, they don't really give any guidance on practical applications of the commands.
2018-09-24 18:07:38	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> ^
2018-09-24 18:07:49	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes
2018-09-24 18:07:51	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Exactly
2018-09-24 18:07:59	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I wanted to make like a tutorial with a 68k emulator built in
2018-09-24 18:08:09	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> I seem to recall that some of the lack of it when I first joined was half legitimately not having gone through the process of disassembling and documentation and half gatekeeping
2018-09-24 18:08:10	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> This is one of my main difficulties to learn the ASM, I admit.
2018-09-24 18:08:12	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and like a helpful hints for instructions and whatnot
2018-09-24 18:08:24	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> I've only read the first section of that guide, and while it did make plenty of things suddenly click, you still have to put time into learning how the Sonic engine itself puts the code to use
2018-09-24 18:08:29	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> not like to hold their hands, buit provide easier environment for practical application and learning instructions
2018-09-24 18:08:33	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like it would be really cool to make
2018-09-24 18:08:34	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but hard
2018-09-24 18:08:40	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I dotn have the time right now
2018-09-24 18:08:48	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> It's one of the reasons I want to get a YouTube channel up and running at some point with decent video tutorials and examples, not like the shit GameHut has been knocking out for "coding a Sonic game" which teaches how copy and paste works
2018-09-24 18:09:11	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ^
2018-09-24 18:09:14	+Dick-Cord	<l​ion> what is happening
2018-09-24 18:09:15	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> also how to not write code
2018-09-24 18:09:29	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> seriously though
2018-09-24 18:09:49	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Ive been debating making a topic about arranging people to create tools and write like documentation on many aspects of hacking and such
2018-09-24 18:09:58	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but I am a bit cynical and feel it wont go anywhere
2018-09-24 18:10:20	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Isn't this a independant (I mean, particular) thought?
2018-09-24 18:10:24	+Dick-Cord	<G​abriel the flying shark> heya
2018-09-24 18:10:34	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> People who have had some programming background pick it up quickly because the fundamentals of applying code is already known to them. For anyone without a background, while they may know what add, sub and cmp commands do, without seeing them put to use it becomes a bit daunting

2018-09-24 18:11:26	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I mean honestly, if people want to help, I am down to helping arrange proper teams and such to actually work on tools, guides and documentation
2018-09-24 18:11:30	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like even better disasemblies
2018-09-24 18:11:46	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and we've been spitballing with Spanner and Lazly about this before, and nothing came of it
2018-09-24 18:12:25	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Tools aren't my strong point, but I'm working on a version of a Sonic 2 disassembly at the moment which should hopefully be a bit more beginner friendly, and I'm always up for documentation as long as it's accurate
2018-09-24 18:12:32	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> You would think they'd learn from the fact that nobody ever helps the "do it for me folk"
2018-09-24 18:12:50	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> To be fair, those posts all get trashed
2018-09-24 18:12:53	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> what I would like for disassemblies, is doing it right™
2018-09-24 18:13:12	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> which none of the current disassemblies actualyl do
2018-09-24 18:13:13	+Dick-Cord	<S​panNepu> @Miss Fox I think the issue has been down to the whole xf2 upgrade / server move stuff stalling things.
2018-09-24 18:13:23	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yea
2018-09-24 18:13:24	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> it's like there should be red 24 pt impact bold disclaimers all over
2018-09-24 18:13:27	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> but they'd still ignore that
2018-09-24 18:13:28	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I had those few tools written as well
2018-09-24 18:13:32	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> which was fun to wrok onm
2018-09-24 18:13:41	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Well one thing I'm doing is working from the XenoSonic S2 disassembly as a base and only adding in the macros I feel add something of value and simplify things. Some just seem to be there for the sake of being there
2018-09-24 18:13:42	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> never got to show them off because migration didnt happen yet
2018-09-24 18:14:12	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> what I would like, is make disassemblies that are easy to edit, not necessarily bit-perfect
2018-09-24 18:14:26	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and ones that use macros to simplify repeated code or things like VDP addressing
2018-09-24 18:14:32	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> What macros in git aren't helpful in your opinion? I've yet to stumble across one I disliked
2018-09-24 18:14:33	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and none of thatAS shit :V
2018-09-24 18:14:41	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> having a good assembler would help in this too
2018-09-24 18:14:48	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> The deep dive stuff has been extremely helpful fwiw. For example, amphobius/dalek's mid2smps video helped a shitton. Markey indirectly taught me about the object format due to working on a project where he'd previously made some well commented level objects. The whole teach a man to fish thing.
2018-09-24 18:15:12	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> @Miss Fox You asked a few minutes earlier how we solve this, but that's the thing; you can't exactly "solve" feelings. Any community fosters its own, unavoidable form of Social Darwinism. It's survival of the fittest through and through, and those that are not mentally tough enough to deal with the community and adapt to its changes will, unfortunately, fall into obscurity. Natural selection is a cruel mistress.
2018-09-24 18:15:22	+Dick-Cord	*M​iss Fox* makearttile is shit
2018-09-24 18:15:29	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> I'm also splitting things up and rerstructuring the folders so everything is easy to find for fast editing without having to search through hundreds of files to find what you need. You need EHZ art, mappings data, layouts, palettes and such. Open the EHZ folder and there it all is, no confusion
2018-09-24 18:15:55	%MainMemory	I think make_art_tile is incredibly useful
2018-09-24 18:16:10	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> @Nat The Porcupine well exactly
2018-09-24 18:16:15	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> no its not MM
2018-09-24 18:16:18	@Lil-G	isn't make_art_tile a macro
2018-09-24 18:16:29	%MainMemory	it allows constants to be used
2018-09-24 18:16:33	+Dick-Cord	*M​iss Fox* makearttile is unneededly cluttery, and solves a non-issue
2018-09-24 18:16:33	@Lil-G	i think i had to turn that into a subroutine
2018-09-24 18:16:38	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> What would a viable alternative be for an assembler? Just ASM68k with your z80 macros?
2018-09-24 18:16:39	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes you can OR as well
2018-09-24 18:16:40	+Dick-Cord	*P​acca* makearttile is like my favorite macro, object vram locations were incomprehensible to me until I saw that in action
2018-09-24 18:16:43	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its no big deal
2018-09-24 18:16:45	@Lil-G	i really need to fix that
2018-09-24 18:16:52	%MainMemory	Lil-G: make_art_tile is a function
2018-09-24 18:17:11	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> @IWasAPerson without any better one, yes
2018-09-24 18:17:21	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> If I hadn't certain MSN conversations with Teaker in the past, I'd possibly not know about the format of sound effects per example. I think that Stephen is right in his statement. Perhaps a deeper explanation or documentation would be better than having too much tools, I dunno.
2018-09-24 18:17:25	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> learning what the each bit does is not difficult job
2018-09-24 18:17:41	%MainMemory	no, it's not
2018-09-24 18:17:42	@Lil-G	ah right, function not macro
2018-09-24 18:17:48	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like when I learned VDP stuff for the first time, it took me under an hour to udnerstand what all of it was
2018-09-24 18:17:56	%MainMemory	but that doesn't mean I want to write it out every time
2018-09-24 18:18:03	@Lil-G	but i had to turn it into a subroutine because of the dynamic vram thing
2018-09-24 18:18:08	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> even then, if you insisted on it, you could find better ways to make the macro
2018-09-24 18:18:32	%MainMemory	more constants?
2018-09-24 18:18:34	+Dick-Cord	*M​iss Fox* writing $1234 etc is faster than makearttile($234,1,0 or whatever else
2018-09-24 18:18:48	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and its easier to see at a glance
2018-09-24 18:19:15	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> any time a value is split up between an actual number and bitflags, it feels pretty counterintuitive for me. just my honest opinion.
2018-09-24 18:19:49	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I mean hell, you could find a way to make them equates, say, $234|pal1|xfl
2018-09-24 18:20:01	@Lil-G	that sounds like more work than its worth
2018-09-24 18:20:03	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I mean at that point it loses a lot of readability but you dotn have to to think of the number itself
2018-09-24 18:20:14	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> That works too I suppose. They both accomplish the same thing though
2018-09-24 18:20:18	%MainMemory	that would be better than what we have
2018-09-24 18:20:51	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but there are macros like bytestoLcnt which are just plainly stupid
2018-09-24 18:20:58	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its easier to just divide by 4 ffs
2018-09-24 18:21:02	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> That reminds me, the git disassembly still needs constants for the collision flags for objects
2018-09-24 18:21:04	%MainMemory	and subtract 1
2018-09-24 18:21:05	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Would the current guides need to be expanded to make them be simpler or more practiceable in a way?
2018-09-24 18:21:06	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and it makes it easier for people not familiar with the macros
2018-09-24 18:21:09	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes true
2018-09-24 18:21:14	@Lil-G	i mean, with make_art_tile we can use existing constants and not have to make duplicates
2018-09-24 18:21:18	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ($400-$40)/4-1 easy
2018-09-24 18:21:29	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Lil-G I explained why this is irrelevant
2018-09-24 18:21:36	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> $123|pal1|xfl
2018-09-24 18:21:48	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> need only few equates
2018-09-24 18:22:00	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> My preference leads more towards verbose than shorthand, I mean in the art case I always thought the way of commenting in smps2asm was a good way of describing the function while not affecting the readability
2018-09-24 18:22:07	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> My only issue is that many tutorials on Retro are more towards Hiv disasm and I cannot find some guides for GitHub one. Despite that I like to try learning/working on my own.
2018-09-24 18:22:14	@Lil-G	still, i'd like to be able to read what's going on rather than try to guess what this means
2018-09-24 18:22:15	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> actually yeah, if you use constants, that or format is more verbose then the function
2018-09-24 18:22:38	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> even with the smps2asm format I created a shorterhand method, trying to increase readibility while making me type less
2018-09-24 18:22:51	+Dick-Cord	*M​iss Fox* but generally name like makearttile is just ugly, too long, and gets in the way
2018-09-24 18:22:54	+Dick-Cord	*P​acca* makearttile doesn't explicitly make it clear what the two numbers after do without diggin through the macro code
2018-09-24 18:22:57	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> which is why it gotta go
2018-09-24 18:23:02	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> also its not portable
2018-09-24 18:23:06	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> which is an saside
2018-09-24 18:23:17	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> @LordXernom It's because we don't have a universal disassembled code in any form. There's a huge quantity of different disassemblies. If we focused only in the most up-to-date ones, certainly newbie's life would be easier... I think.
2018-09-24 18:23:22	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> exactly Pacca
2018-09-24 18:23:24	@Lil-G	i don't really mind the long name because i usually just copy and paste the name anyway
2018-09-24 18:23:26	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and the name is not obvious either
2018-09-24 18:23:27	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> Like in the line above it make a comment describing its usage then use the actual function below
2018-09-24 18:23:27	@Lil-G	:V
2018-09-24 18:23:30	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Yeah
2018-09-24 18:24:03	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I'd rather have comments be inline
2018-09-24 18:24:14	%MainMemory	there are many things in the s2 disasm that aren't portable
2018-09-24 18:24:21	%MainMemory	are we going to roll back all of them?
2018-09-24 18:24:21	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> else if you have comment before each line, its just gonna be difficult to modify
2018-09-24 18:24:35	@Lil-G	i mean, make_art_tile isn't really that long compared to a lot of the subroutine names
2018-09-24 18:24:37	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> @MainMemory I don't think so.
2018-09-24 18:24:47	@Lil-G	or variable names
2018-09-24 18:24:50	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well not necessarily, I am just not a fan of the S2 disasem in general and AS is a piece of crap
2018-09-24 18:25:07	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Lil-G yes also another reason why I dislike the git disasemblies
2018-09-24 18:25:17	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> You guys should see some of my label names, some of them rival small paragraphs because I abuse copy/paste :derpsonic:
2018-09-24 18:25:18	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> too long routine and variable names
2018-09-24 18:25:27	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and not long to be descriptive, but long for the sake of being long
2018-09-24 18:25:48	@Lil-G	still, i don't mind because i just use autocomplete and copy/paste
2018-09-24 18:25:56	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> i much rather try to get away with as few characterrs, while being as specific as I need to be with the name
2018-09-24 18:26:04	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well all of us dont so
2018-09-24 18:26:09	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> I think however the macros get handled, they need to be made standard across the series wherever possible. If we start dividing them up again with different label names, macros and equates then it'll only confuse matters
2018-09-24 18:26:11	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> plus its ugly
2018-09-24 18:26:21	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes
2018-09-24 18:26:32	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> all lables that are equivalent, should have the same name accross games
2018-09-24 18:26:34	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> We need to agree on a universal set of names for every disassembly
2018-09-24 18:26:37	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> whereever that is possible
2018-09-24 18:26:45	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> Fair, inline gets the same point across. What was the breaking point for you with AS? Had really dumb problems with it myself but you make it sound like it killed your dog
2018-09-24 18:26:51	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Yes. Indeed, Stephen
2018-09-24 18:26:59	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well ok
2018-09-24 18:27:07	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> That's one thing I want to do actually, is modify S1 git to use S2 gits variable names
2018-09-24 18:27:08	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I've bitched about it a lot in the past year or so in here
2018-09-24 18:27:18	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> issue 1: 100% valid code doesnt always assemble
2018-09-24 18:27:22	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> and routine names
2018-09-24 18:27:29	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> sometimes when you insert more data near the beginning, it suddenly assembles
2018-09-24 18:27:37	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> despite no issue anywhere in the disasemble
2018-09-24 18:27:39	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> Had the first problem too
2018-09-24 18:27:49	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Yeah, that bs where you have to shuffle data is a pain
2018-09-24 18:28:00	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> issue 2: 100% valid code, especially offsets of ax or pc, do not assemble and throw  up seemingly random errors
2018-09-24 18:28:06	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> 3: error messages not helpful
2018-09-24 18:28:26	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Renaming labels and variable names confuses most of the times. Per example... while I was stepping my friend to insert the Spin-dash in his GIT Sonic 1 source, I became confused lots of times and we took various hours to finish something that would just take a few minutes.
2018-09-24 18:28:27	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> 4: it takes fuckign forever to assembly anything, like talking soemtimes 30+ seconds for Markeys laptop
2018-09-24 18:28:31	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> just for S3K
2018-09-24 18:28:41	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Especially since I'm clinging to rom space right now, having meaningless nonsense fill my rom just to compile is not helping me
2018-09-24 18:28:47	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> 5: It sometimes assembles instructiosn wrong for no reason and assembling second time fixes it
2018-09-24 18:29:00	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> 6: Sometimes some very simple things do not work as you expect or at all
2018-09-24 18:29:10	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> 7: the integration with Z80 is buggy at best
2018-09-24 18:29:15	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> 8: 64-bit internal variable
2018-09-24 18:29:39	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> AS sometimes assembles successfully on one machine, but the same exact disassembly will not build on another. Never understood that :sonicmaniawoah:
2018-09-24 18:29:41	+Dick-Cord	*N​at The Porcupine* Look, I really hate to interrupt the riffing on makearttile, AS(s), ect., but there's been a new development: I think it's possible that FireRat is trying to pull a UT.

2018-09-24 18:29:46	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> 9: Sometimes clearly invalid code assembles into clearly invalid binary buit it does not complain
2018-09-24 18:30:04	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> 10: The macro system is balls
2018-09-24 18:30:21	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> I'd probably deny what he's saying if I knew what I would be denying, but he lost me pretty early on
2018-09-24 18:30:27	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> Nat, I don't see a point to have been showing this.
2018-09-24 18:30:37	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> I'm submitting my sonic skin in minecraft to SAGE 2019 guys
2018-09-24 18:30:43	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> shooting up to first place
2018-09-24 18:30:44	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ophmygod rly Nat
2018-09-24 18:30:46	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> fuckign a
2018-09-24 18:31:04	%MainMemory	you have a lot of valid points, but then you resort to just insulting it without describing what the problems are
2018-09-24 18:31:29	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well anyway 10 reasons why AS is ASS, I'd have more if I could think of it atm
2018-09-24 18:31:56	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> is there a worst submissions section in SAGE
2018-09-24 18:31:59	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes I like insulting AS
2018-09-24 18:32:07	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> sorry but it is just a terrible påiece of crap
2018-09-24 18:32:29	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> FireRat made a couple of valid points but then pulled some from his arse, so I don't know what he's expecting. If people want to leave why don't they just adopt a bit of willpower and fuck off of their own accord instead of trying to instigate a ban. That's the sort of shit my 10 year old nephew would do
2018-09-24 18:32:48	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> ...I was just expecting a complaint on the pc offset bullshit and I've seen  you complain a lot about it. Thought there was a straw that broke the camel's back moment but goddamn that's way more informative
2018-09-24 18:32:50	%MainMemory	I completely agree with the first 9 points you made
2018-09-24 18:32:52	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> because ban me textwalls make them think they win
2018-09-24 18:32:58	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> I don't think FireRat wants a ban. They're just in a funk mood.
2018-09-24 18:32:59	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> that's the point
2018-09-24 18:33:18	+Dick-Cord	*F​ireRat* ah no, if you meant by what I said in that other Discord chat, that was a "mild joke" ¯\(ツ)/¯
2018-09-24 18:33:41	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Fair enough. As I said earlier, you kinda lost me halfway down that post and I lost the point you were makign
2018-09-24 18:33:42	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> alright then
2018-09-24 18:33:43	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> well ok MM
2018-09-24 18:33:44	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> I wouldn't like this to happen, @StephenUK . I may be wrong, but I'm feeling all of this as a venting
2018-09-24 18:33:51	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> derpVARIABLEwhoops
2018-09-24 18:33:57	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> oh Discord you
2018-09-24 18:34:08	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ignore the underline its 2x underscore
2018-09-24 18:34:20	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> that is how you do "dynamic" lable names
2018-09-24 18:34:24	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> or dynamic any names
2018-09-24 18:34:30	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> no other way it seems
2018-09-24 18:34:35	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> really sad if oyhu think about it
2018-09-24 18:34:46	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I struggled with this for hours few months back
2018-09-24 18:34:47	%MainMemory	there are ways to do it
2018-09-24 18:34:59	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I could not find any way on the manual or anything
2018-09-24 18:35:06	%MainMemory	I'm pretty sure I did something once
2018-09-24 18:35:09	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I know that way because the Git disasesmblies do it
2018-09-24 18:35:20	%MainMemory	but I don't know if I can find the code right now
2018-09-24 18:35:24	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> manual had no mention from searching it for few hours
2018-09-24 18:35:25	+Dick-Cord	<F​ireRat> StephenUK, sorry but not every single thing I say in a day has a point... it really was like a vent at times but like I said, it was difficult and spent almost a month on that. But I've tried my best to not fall into that, sorry
2018-09-24 18:35:35	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> dynamic label names and temp labels freak me out, I always prefer to just copy the code into another window, find-replace a name in the code, then copy it back in
2018-09-24 18:35:42	%MainMemory	something involving curly braces?
2018-09-24 18:35:52	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> oh
2018-09-24 18:35:54	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> maybe?
2018-09-24 18:35:59	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> honestly I am not sure
2018-09-24 18:36:12	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> thats just 1 example of many
2018-09-24 18:36:27	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> we should talk about something more important
2018-09-24 18:36:30	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I am really not happy how nonstandard the system is, like anything that works vaguely the same on many assemblers does not work in AS
2018-09-24 18:36:31	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> like what I should eat today
2018-09-24 18:36:39	%MainMemory	anyway, ASM68K is not without issues itself, and there are a few things AS has that I really like
2018-09-24 18:36:40	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> pizza
2018-09-24 18:36:46	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> god damn it nat
2018-09-24 18:36:48	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes I agree
2018-09-24 18:36:49	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> I want to
2018-09-24 18:36:53	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> but I had that yesterday
2018-09-24 18:36:59	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ASM68K's macro system is also very quirky
2018-09-24 18:37:03	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and frustrating
2018-09-24 18:37:06	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> What truly differs from a disassembler to the other one? (Sorry, I'm newbie at this)
2018-09-24 18:37:11	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but yet, it allows me to do many cool and unexpected things
2018-09-24 18:37:12	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> and I'd rather not have heartburn for the next month
2018-09-24 18:37:15	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ...like pseudo arrays
2018-09-24 18:37:25	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> All I know is that the splitup of files and the dynamic labels makes it extremely difficult to navigate the S1 github disasm
2018-09-24 18:37:28	%MainMemory	but in general, I'd rather be coding in C++ anyway, which is why I like PC games so much
2018-09-24 18:37:29	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> FireRat, I get that not everything you say has to have a point, but for a wall of text like that it's not unnatural to assume there would be one to make. A fair amount of what you said seemed to be playing on years gone by and wasn't really relevant to the community today, unless something happened I'm not aware of that has made you feel that way
2018-09-24 18:37:30	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I tried that in AS too but couldnt figure out a way to pull it off
2018-09-24 18:37:49	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I wanted to make a macro system kinda like just pseudo-C# code
2018-09-24 18:37:57	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like actual good one whcih somewhat standard syntax
2018-09-24 18:38:08	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but then I'd have to put some time aside from coding an assembler
2018-09-24 18:38:12	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> lolno kthx
2018-09-24 18:38:24	%MainMemory	oh hey
2018-09-24 18:38:28	%MainMemory	I think I found it
2018-09-24 18:38:30	%MainMemory	ArtTile_TC_{"\{t}"} := -1
2018-09-24 18:38:30	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Wasn't SuperEgg supposed to be setting up some kind of Pseudo-C disassembly? I seem to recall something like that
2018-09-24 18:38:47	%MainMemory	yes, it's really awkward
2018-09-24 18:38:49	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> >_>
2018-09-24 18:38:50	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> O.O
2018-09-24 18:38:51	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> what the fuck
2018-09-24 18:38:51	%MainMemory	but it is possible
2018-09-24 18:39:02	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> huh
2018-09-24 18:39:04	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> idk
2018-09-24 18:39:13	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> talking about assembler tho not disassembly
2018-09-24 18:39:26	%MainMemory	that inserts the value of the t variable into the label name
2018-09-24 18:39:27	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> OwO
2018-09-24 18:39:39	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> atleast there is a way
2018-09-24 18:39:49	+Dick-Cord	<E​MK-20218> @Miss Fox Yeah, my bad.
2018-09-24 18:39:53	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> in ASM68K I'd do like "derp\variable\oops"
2018-09-24 18:40:02	%MainMemory	I used it in my titlecard mappings macro
2018-09-24 18:40:02	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> not really all that eloquent but hey it works
2018-09-24 18:40:19	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> oh yeah I meant Stephen
2018-09-24 18:40:42	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but yeah when you really dig deep into assemblers you see how different - and crap - they are
2018-09-24 18:40:59	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I still like ASM68K for getting most things kinda right™
2018-09-24 18:41:00	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Yeah I was trying to have two conversations at once so I missed the part about assembler and thought you were talking about disassemblies still
2018-09-24 18:41:05	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> its also notably much faster than AS
2018-09-24 18:41:13	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> no z80 assembly tho
2018-09-24 18:41:20	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> Is the curly braces one for asm68k or as? Looks weird as hell but anything that gets it closer to c++ is good
2018-09-24 18:41:21	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ahah
2018-09-24 18:41:24	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yeah
2018-09-24 18:41:32	%MainMemory	with AS, it helps if you write your code so that it only takes two passes

2018-09-24 18:41:49	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> in ASM68K you only get 2 passes ;)
2018-09-24 18:42:00	%MainMemory	you can force AS to only do two passes
2018-09-24 18:42:04	%MainMemory	I always do
2018-09-24 18:42:16	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but yes I dont think any disassembly works in 2 passes
2018-09-24 18:42:17	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> I tried asmx once. It was okay.
2018-09-24 18:42:21	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> especially S3K, its such a huge masterpiece of fuckeryt
2018-09-24 18:42:26	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> Isn't asmx buggy though?
2018-09-24 18:42:37	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> atleast its not SNASM68K ;D
2018-09-24 18:42:40	%MainMemory	hm, maybe that should be changed in the future
2018-09-24 18:42:43	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> a little
2018-09-24 18:42:48	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I dont think it can be
2018-09-24 18:42:55	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like honestly not for S3K
2018-09-24 18:43:02	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> nothing a source mod couldn't fix though
2018-09-24 18:43:04	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> unless you assemble Z80 dirver separately
2018-09-24 18:43:09	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> which you could do
2018-09-24 18:43:36	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> I like how Death Mountain is the only thing consistently named between the Light and Dark World in A Link to the Past
2018-09-24 18:44:33	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> makes it real confusing when you're told to go somewhere for an item and it's turns out you just have to go to THE OTHER dimension instead
2018-09-24 18:44:44	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but uhh
2018-09-24 18:44:47	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> detours!
2018-09-24 18:45:46	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> Lobo, that is so out of nowhere but you bring up a great point. That loathsome landmark is consistently in Lorule too if I'm not mistaken.
2018-09-24 18:45:54	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> lets talk about changing things and not change things
2018-09-24 18:45:57	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> seems familiar
2018-09-24 18:46:48	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> I have a link between worlds but my ex took my 3DS on the way out
2018-09-24 18:46:54	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> so I'm replaying ALTTP instead
2018-09-24 18:47:19	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> well shit
2018-09-24 18:47:40	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> We need an organized spot for ideas or directions on making changes or cleaning things up otherwise it's gonna be a scattered pipe dream.
2018-09-24 18:47:48	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Is Link Between Worlds worth getting? It's one of those games I've considered picking up every time I've seen it being sold, but never actually convinced myself to buy it
2018-09-24 18:47:49	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> Shit lobo, sorry to hear
2018-09-24 18:47:57	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yep
2018-09-24 18:47:58	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> we do
2018-09-24 18:48:05	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> This is truly one of those games that is like riding a bike in terms of things you never forget once you've done them once
2018-09-24 18:48:11	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> we also need the forum update but shit happens so I guess not =D
2018-09-24 18:48:18	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> My uncle had a gamecube I was going to borrow not too long ago but apparently one of his exes did the same with that
2018-09-24 18:48:33	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> kind of fun to cruise through it like though
2018-09-24 18:49:00	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> @IWasAPerson that happened like two years ago, haha, and in truth I just gave it to her
2018-09-24 18:49:11	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> I wanted a New 3DS and never ended up buying one
2018-09-24 18:49:12	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> he also had a nintendo 64 and the same thing happened with that so...
2018-09-24 18:50:20	%MainMemory	ALBW was my first Zelda
2018-09-24 18:50:22	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> no, the people who really steal my shit are the ones I rent rooms to
2018-09-24 18:50:40	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> @StephenUK I think so. It's not going to hold the same lasting nostalgic impact that ALTTP does, but I think it offers enough new stuff that deviates from the traditional formula that make it worth playing.
2018-09-24 18:51:06	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> BOTW though 👌
2018-09-24 18:51:12	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> and now I keep my guns unlocked and in plain view to convince the future ones not to do that
2018-09-24 18:51:13	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> good shit
2018-09-24 18:51:17	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> not that I'd kill over a video game
2018-09-24 18:51:22	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> but it's persuasive, you know

2018-09-24 18:52:12	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> legally you'll get fucked over if you maim someone in a defense situation rather than kill them
2018-09-24 18:52:13	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> Twilight Princess is my favorite Zelda with Ocarina of Time being a close second
2018-09-24 18:52:29	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> that's why cops don't kneecap anyone anymore
2018-09-24 18:52:44	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> too many lawsuits, and now there are additional laws about it
2018-09-24 18:53:04	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> even if the former had flaws I think they nailed it with the atmosphere and overall narrative, why can't they do that again
2018-09-24 18:53:41	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> it's funny that I mention the theft of my things and specifically a link to the past
2018-09-24 18:53:49	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> because my original copy of that was stolen by a former roommate
2018-09-24 18:54:02	+Dick-Cord	<L​obotomy> as well as OoT and Majora's Mask

2018-09-25 17:24:43	%MainMemory	did you set it to wav format
2018-09-25 17:25:22	+Dick-Cord	<G​4> You have to put .wav after the filename
2018-09-25 17:25:26	+Dick-Cord	<G​4> It works trust me
2018-09-25 17:26:25	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I did set it to wav format, and this is Windows 10 and for some reason that doesn't work.

2018-09-25 20:34:27	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Same here. The guy porting Mighty's art for me can't work on it for a few weeks
2018-09-25 20:34:37	%MainMemory	I should have enough time to do everything I want to do
2018-09-25 20:34:42	%MainMemory	and if I don't, oh well
2018-09-25 20:35:08	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> wouldn't mind that much to be honest, my workflow's been really unorganized and sluggish so I doubt I'll actually get a product worth presenting done before the deadline
2018-09-25 20:35:19	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I could reuse assets from Kyukyoku but it's not Mania's art for Mighty, which is what I need
2018-09-25 20:35:54	%MainMemory	I could probably write a program to port Mania sprites to MD
2018-09-25 20:37:10	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> So... what's a good file host? Mediafire seems pretty bad nowadays.

2018-09-25 20:37:43	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Main, I'd totally support that. Porting Studiopolis would be so much more easy.
2018-09-25 20:37:43	%MainMemory	self-hosting
2018-09-25 20:38:05	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> depends on what you're hosting
2018-09-25 20:38:54	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> The usual. 1 or 2 MB zips files.
2018-09-25 20:40:42	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> If you just want to do quick hotlinking you could upload them to a private discord server, and you'll in theory be able to do that as much as you want as long as the files are under 8MB each
2018-09-25 20:40:54	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> but if you actually want to archive and manage them, it's not very effective
2018-09-25 20:42:05	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> can confirm this seems to work indefinitely
2018-09-25 20:42:18	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I pulled files from 2+ years old conversations with Markey just fine with a tool
2018-09-25 20:42:50	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like literally hundreds of revisions of our hack
2018-09-25 20:42:56	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> and disassemblies
2018-09-25 20:51:00	+Dick-Cord	<S​tephenUK> Failing that, as staff on SSRG we could probably set you up with FTP access and some storage space

2018-09-25 20:52:07	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> I dunno how picky Dropbox is nowadays but I used to use that all the time for smaller files

2018-09-26 02:06:16	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> It'd probably be best to give that AV a taste of its own medicine and delete it permanently.

2018-09-26 03:27:30	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> I did, it ignores it eventually for some reason, presumably because it thinks SonLVL is a hybrid of 4 malwares :derpsonic:

2018-09-26 03:32:11	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> I asked myself "Why bother an AV when you can just avoid the viruses outright by not visiting obviously sketchy websites?"
2018-09-26 03:32:35	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Sometimes they embed shit in the ads though
2018-09-26 03:32:49	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> AdBlock
2018-09-26 03:32:58	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Fair enough.
2018-09-26 03:34:07	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> If I ever somehow contract a virus, I'll just download Malware bytes and take care of it then.
2018-09-26 03:34:57	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> I mean, AVs aren't totally useless.
2018-09-26 03:35:41	+Dick-Cord	<N​at The Porcupine> If you torrent a lot of shit, it would probably be a good idea to at least have one on standby.

2018-09-26 14:05:32	djohe|com3	MainMemory remind me how to delete duped/unused tiles on 8x8 tiles and 16x16 blocks that is shared but the 128x128's are not between "two" levels
2018-09-26 14:06:24	%MainMemory	uh
2018-09-26 14:06:32	djohe|com3	duped/unused tiles & blocks *
2018-09-26 14:07:46	%MainMemory	are you saying this is something we've discussed before?
2018-09-26 14:07:57	djohe|com3	I have no idea
2018-09-26 14:08:56	djohe|com3	basically I am right now messing around with a Sonic CD zone but as you know they tend to have their own set of chunks for each act but the tiles and blocks are identical
2018-09-26 14:09:57	djohe|com3	and if you told me how to do it in the past I have forgotten about how to do it in SonLVL
2018-09-26 14:12:15	%MainMemory	well, you could back up the block file, delete the  unused blocks from one level, revert the block file, then delete the unused tiles/blocks in the other level
2018-09-26 14:12:52	djohe|com3	that would mess up the chunks in the other level
2018-09-26 14:13:57	%MainMemory	why?
2018-09-26 14:14:27	djohe|com3	because it would shift block ID's in the chunks and the chunk file is not shared
2018-09-26 14:14:32	djohe|com3	between the levels
2018-09-26 14:15:07	%MainMemory	as long as you delete the same blocks both times, there's no problem
2018-09-26 14:15:46	djohe|com3	sure but I wanted to press the delete unused/dupe buttons in SonLVL
2018-09-26 14:16:09	%MainMemory	well, maybe you could try merging the chunk sets
2018-09-26 14:16:35	djohe|com3	only solution I can come up with to solve this is to make new chunk format that is twice the size because I am at $FF chunks for each level
2018-09-26 14:17:02	%MainMemory	SonLVL should be able to read a chunk file with more than 256 chunks
2018-09-26 14:17:09	djohe|com3	it can?
2018-09-26 14:17:19	djohe|com3	ok I will try that then
2018-09-26 14:17:28	%MainMemory	I mean, I didn't specifically put a cap on it when loading
2018-09-26 14:17:50	 *	djohe|com3 tests
2018-09-26 14:18:08	%MainMemory	I can't guarantee everything will work, I might use byte indexes somewhere
2018-09-26 14:26:07	djohe|com3	ohh wow it actually worked... now to see if it saves properly too
2018-09-26 14:28:26	djohe|com3	looks like it cleared all chunks over $FF
2018-09-26 14:28:30	djohe|com3	bleh
2018-09-26 14:29:00	djohe|com3	was kinda expecting that tho
2018-09-26 14:29:43	djohe|com3	mabe I can dump a set of $FF chunks and then another set of $FF chunks 
2018-09-26 14:29:57	djohe|com3	as a workaround for the save issue
2018-09-26 14:36:48	djohe|com3	nvm I just counted wrong, it did save properly all $1FF chunks
2018-09-26 14:37:02	djohe|com3	insert djohe FAIL here
2018-09-26 14:38:29	%MainMemory	actually, you could just load both files together into the chunk list, without having to manually merge and split them
2018-09-26 14:38:51	%MainMemory	chunks=file1.bin|file2.bin
2018-09-26 14:39:52	djohe|com3	imo it is safer to merge and split then then using patch method
2018-09-26 14:54:31	%MainMemory	why
2018-09-26 14:54:48	%MainMemory	you end up with the same result either way
2018-09-26 16:01:06	djohe|com3	lol this is a BIG NO... 50C tiles after deleting unused/duped blocks and converting to 2P format for tiles
2018-09-26 16:02:48	djohe|com3	now to check how many tiles it is if I delete all of the BG
2018-09-26 16:09:52	djohe|com3	hmmm that number looks much more reasonable

2018-09-26 18:29:39	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> it's not all busted up like hell only "slightly"
2018-09-26 18:33:55	djohe|AFK	Jorge that is because that disassembly I gave you I actually tried to make CPZ 2P a thing, it has since been removed and just tile ID movement to only make some blocks look ok
2018-09-26 18:34:56	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> yeye I remember it lulz
2018-09-26 18:34:59	djohe|AFK	this ARZ picture was also a worst case scenario place, it does not look that bad all over the place
2018-09-26 18:35:21	djohe|AFK	this specific place has BG fucking with FG a ton
2018-09-26 18:36:23	djohe|AFK	and my optimized 16x16 block convertor hates that
2018-09-26 18:36:25	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> the funny thing is that I left it as it was in S2RL, but killed the horizontal blank routine that was handling 2P water in the process of rewriting it

2018-09-26 18:42:45	djohe|AFK	so it does not fuck with FG at all
2018-09-26 18:43:18	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> does ARz reload the BG plane as you move?
2018-09-26 18:43:47	djohe|AFK	yes... but the issue is the tile numbering that fucks with my optmized 16x16 convertor
2018-09-26 18:44:10	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> what is that
2018-09-26 18:44:24	djohe|AFK	Sonic2 converts the 16x16 block file's tile numbers when a level loads
2018-09-26 18:44:29	djohe|AFK	in 2P VS mode
2018-09-26 18:44:37	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> is it some consecutive indexer for 8x16 tiles or wat
2018-09-26 18:44:45	djohe|AFK	it needs to halve all the numbers
2018-09-26 18:44:56	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> yeah assuming all of them are sequential
2018-09-26 18:45:18	djohe|AFK	and I optimized the convertor to skip half of everything
2018-09-26 18:45:38	djohe|AFK	to make it use less RAM for blocks in 2P mode
2018-09-26 18:46:12	djohe|AFK	but it also makes non 2P compatible zones PUKE harder
2018-09-26 18:50:50	djohe|AFK	I rather have $C00 of spare ram for anything then having "non" 2P zones looking slightly better in interlaced display mode
2018-09-26 18:51:17	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> but that extra space is only in 2P right
2018-09-26 18:51:21	djohe|AFK	yes
2018-09-26 18:53:06	djohe|AFK	RAM space allocated for blocks is normally $9000-$A7FF in orignal S2 1P or 2P VS but I get away with having it only be $9000-$9BFF in my hacks 2P VS
2018-09-26 18:53:40	djohe|AFK	all thanks to tiles being 8x16 instead of 8x8
2018-09-26 18:54:36	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> and what data do you have that is 2P exclusive that could go here
2018-09-26 18:54:47	djohe|AFK	nothing currently
2018-09-26 18:55:02	djohe|AFK	the fuckery with the art in my hack is related to how I compute the conversion process
2018-09-26 18:55:10	djohe|AFK	compared to how orignal S2 does it
2018-09-26 19:04:55	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> btw wdjohe do you know anything peculiarabout CNz's pattern reloading
2018-09-26 19:05:11	djohe|com3	what about it?
2018-09-26 19:05:57	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> it seems one of those flipping blocks (star/sonic) is writing to some bullshit vram loaction (on top of the correct tile destination)
2018-09-26 19:06:06	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> the one with moon/tails seems to be fine
2018-09-26 19:07:13	djohe|com3	have you checked unmodified S2?
2018-09-26 19:07:20	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> because my 2P HBI routine is broken, the 2P field is not drawn, but rather the continuation of P1's
2018-09-26 19:07:54	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> so when this "block" flips I see junk tile reloading on the bottom field

2018-09-26 19:09:20	djohe|com3	because 2P VS has it not in same place as 1P does
2018-09-26 19:10:04	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> so these tiles are in the unseen plade table area?

2018-09-26 20:02:26	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> yes it's the colision enable

2018-09-26 20:06:16	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Looks better broken done imo

2018-09-26 20:12:56	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I hate every S2 zone.
2018-09-26 20:13:01	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> Is it bad that I like Oil Ocean Zone.
2018-09-26 20:13:02	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> why's that?
2018-09-26 20:13:42	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> and no, OOZ is pretty neat, although the palette is a little too vibrant for my tastes
2018-09-26 20:14:03	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> @AkumaYin I guess I never had a problem with the badniks
2018-09-26 20:14:16	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> OOZ is one of my favorite zones in Mania, and I particularly enjoyed the boss. No joke!
2018-09-26 20:14:37	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> yeah, i loved how the Fire Shield reacts to the oil
2018-09-26 20:14:53	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> and the Act 2 music ␤oh good lord is it great
2018-09-26 20:15:49	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> The small nods to Knuckles' Chaotix with the ships were also really cool!
2018-09-26 20:18:20	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> EHZ is just GHZ. ␤CPZ is a cluttered mess. ␤CNZ doesn't look like anything when examining closely.. ␤ARZ Is just ech. ␤HTZ is just EHZ which is just GHZ ␤MCZ same as ARZ, but the palette contrasts nicely. ␤OOZ Only the background is worth looking at. ␤SCZ is just cloud so eh. ␤WFZ works for what it is but I would make it more FBZ like ␤DEZ is just CPZ and once again, CPZ is too cluttered.
2018-09-26 20:18:24	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Er
2018-09-26 20:18:27	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> There's still more
2018-09-26 20:18:34	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> MZ makes no sense
2018-09-26 20:18:52	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> HPZ is just odd
2018-09-26 20:18:53	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Ok that's it
2018-09-26 20:18:55	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Oh dear

2018-09-26 20:19:26	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> i got nothing
2018-09-26 20:19:32	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> I love how "it's just ech" can dismiss an entire zone :sonicmaniawoah:

2018-09-26 20:20:08	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I smell noobiness
2018-09-26 20:20:09	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> also EHZ is really nice when you've been through GHZ countless times and have played loads and loads of GHZ bootlegs in hacks
2018-09-26 20:20:29	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I feel like EHZ is a GHZ bootleg
2018-09-26 20:20:38	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> I loved how Aquatic Ruin Zone could let you go through the entire thing without going in the water.
2018-09-26 20:20:54	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> EHZ is basically a direct upgrade to GHZ. Cleaner more advanced artwork, less slow areas, no instadeath spikes, only like one death pit, and that's just of the top of my head
2018-09-26 20:20:55	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> I'm just sick of orange, brown and green at this point
2018-09-26 20:21:12	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> dont forget blue
2018-09-26 20:21:15	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> no by bootleg I mean like "winter" and "autumn" zones that are just palette edits of GHZ with minor tile alterations
2018-09-26 20:21:17	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> And I'm not judging level design, I'm talking about art
2018-09-26 20:21:20	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Heck, GHZ steals EHZs' spiral loops in every remake of it

2018-09-26 20:22:17	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Nope
2018-09-26 20:22:21	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> don't see one
2018-09-26 20:22:27	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Don't see a clock tower, but orange sonic is weird :derpsonic:
2018-09-26 20:22:38	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> i think that's the time warp screen thing
2018-09-26 20:22:39	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> Where Sonic flies through in the time travel cutscene?

2018-09-26 20:23:09	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> I see a vague outline. Might just be magazine artifacts, or just straight lines to give the cutscene more depth

2018-09-26 20:27:16	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> ....now that I think of it, this might be scanning artifacts explained by the science of paper, polymers and light.
2018-09-26 20:27:20	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> I can see those cloud looking shaded bits, but I again have trouble figuring out if they're intentional or are just scan artifacts
2018-09-26 20:29:25	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> don't think orange sonic is a paper/scan issue lol
2018-09-26 20:29:30	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> hud color is blue btw
2018-09-26 20:29:43	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Maybe it's an early time travel effect?
2018-09-26 20:29:45	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> and rings are also blue
2018-09-26 20:29:55	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> looks like some palette fuckup
2018-09-26 20:30:13	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> The colors are inverted
2018-09-26 20:30:23	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Could be from that clock monitor in betas

2018-09-26 20:30:36	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Don't know why they'd screencap and advertise a goof like that, must be intentional somehow
2018-09-26 20:30:47	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> ahh maybe
2018-09-26 20:36:20	ValleyBell	Kaz: I think it's scan artifacts. The blue right below Sonic seems a tiny bit lighter, but the line goes into the red Palmtree Panic image as well.
2018-09-26 20:58:08	djohe|com3	there we go... ARZ is now less puke artwork wise in interlaced mode
2018-09-26 21:03:01	djohe|com3	still needs more art shifting tho as I only really poked at the background artwork and the tree bridges you can run trough

2018-09-26 21:36:37	%MainMemory	SonLVL only has support for maintaining 2P compatibility within levels that are already designed for it
2018-09-26 21:37:46	%MainMemory	although in theory you could export the full map, clear it, then import it in 2P mode
2018-09-26 21:38:31	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> so it was soned2 then
2018-09-26 21:39:08	%MainMemory	I tried making a tool once, but Marble Zone has some blocks that are completely incompatible with 2P mode
2018-09-26 21:39:13	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> that checks for 16x16s' tiles that are out of alignment and generates dupe tiles where needed
2018-09-26 21:39:35	%MainMemory	yeah
2018-09-26 21:41:20	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> ARz is kinda peculiar that some tiles are not aligned nicely for 2P but if swapped with the one right next to it it will be fine for a number of blocks
2018-09-26 21:41:50	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> so something like
2018-09-26 21:42:08	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> 16 17 -> 16 18
2018-09-26 21:42:20	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> 18 19 -> 17 19
2018-09-26 21:42:58	%MainMemory	export/import would take care of that for you
2018-09-26 21:49:35	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> hum
2018-09-26 21:49:45	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> Ill restore the blocks & art files and give it a try

2018-09-27 18:02:24	djohe|com3	what you just said does not tell me anything because you did not specify what part of the 2P code
2018-09-27 18:16:36	+Dick-Cord	<I​WasAPerson> So I'm hanging out with some friends I haven't seen in quite a while and one of them made an offhand comment about how they had a sega genesis they were looking to get rid of. Been so long since I played anything on real hardware lol
2018-09-27 18:30:18	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> S2 2P mode is messy because the VDP changes the way things are rendered
2018-09-27 18:31:58	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> tiles become bigger and rectangular instead of squares, sprites get extra coordinate bits, framerate changes (not significant for S2)
2018-09-27 18:32:10	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> and then you need to run the game basically twice per frame

2018-09-27 18:35:40	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> drawing & object processing
2018-09-27 18:36:11	djohe|AFK	object processing not really, that is very dependant on player position
2018-09-27 18:36:36	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> yean in SP is also dependant on sonic's position... only
2018-09-27 18:38:08	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Are the file paths correct? THat's typically the most common thing I mess up
2018-09-27 18:38:29	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> sonlvl could have a plane editor 😄
2018-09-27 18:38:36	djohe|AFK	what are you on about Pacca
2018-09-27 18:38:39	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> since it already loads tiles and palettes...
2018-09-27 18:38:56	%MainMemory	yes, it could
2018-09-27 18:38:57	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> MainMemory already said that they might want to do it. I'd love it if that happened
2018-09-27 18:39:12	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> I double checked and yes, the file paths are correct
2018-09-27 18:41:32	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Are they compressed properly? If planeed can't read the file it closes without warning
2018-09-27 18:43:25	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> should be, the art was saved with flex 2 whereas the mappings are a copy of the already existing tile map used for the menu screens in stock Sonic 2
2018-09-27 18:43:43	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> maybe the latter is part of the problem, or I should recompress the art
2018-09-27 18:44:14	djohe|com3	MainMemory remind me does SonLVL have a hotkey for next or previous 16x16 block
2018-09-27 18:44:31	%MainMemory	I don't think so
2018-09-27 18:44:35	djohe|com3	bleh
2018-09-27 18:44:57	djohe|com3	so damn annoying having to move between block editor and tile editor all the time
2018-09-27 18:45:46	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Doesn't it support the arrow keys?
2018-09-27 18:45:50	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> I thought it did
2018-09-27 18:45:52	djohe|com3	not even arrow buttons for next or previous block
2018-09-27 18:48:00	djohe|com3	basically editing one block after another but I have to go tile tab to edit the block and then go back to block tab to change to next block I want to edit
2018-09-27 18:48:17	djohe|com3	was so much easier in SonED2
2018-09-27 18:48:28	djohe|com3	with hotkeys or arrow buttons in the UI
2018-09-27 18:48:38	djohe|com3	while SonLVL does not have any
2018-09-27 18:49:01	%MainMemory	SonLVL has hotkeys
2018-09-27 18:49:09	djohe|com3	yes but not for that
2018-09-27 18:49:27	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> MM when are you making sonAPP
2018-09-27 18:49:36	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> support only for gestures :lulz:
2018-09-27 18:49:43	%MainMemory	there are several hotkeys for editing blocks
2018-09-27 18:49:57	djohe|com3	yes but again
2018-09-27 18:49:57	djohe|com3	[19:44:22] <djohe|com3> MainMemory remind me does SonLVL have a hotkey for next or previous 16x16 block
2018-09-27 18:49:58	djohe|com3	[19:44:39] <%MainMemory> I don't think so
2018-09-27 18:50:01	djohe|com3	not for that
2018-09-27 18:50:08	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> TBH I think a touch interface could work more or less nicely in it
2018-09-27 18:51:00	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> or maybe release tabs from the "tabs" and have them side by side or whatever arrangement the user wants
2018-09-27 18:51:09	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> would be easier to draw things
2018-09-27 18:51:27	djohe|com3	only next or previous 16x16 block buttons for the selected block inside the chunk
2018-09-27 18:52:16	djohe|com3	that does not change the block selected outside the chunk
2018-09-27 18:53:18	+Dick-Cord	<G​4> When are there gonna be sonlvl “tabs” so I can hack sonic 1 and sonic 2 at the same time
2018-09-27 18:53:30	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> It's called windows >w<
2018-09-27 18:53:32	djohe|com3	just open two instances
2018-09-27 18:53:37	djohe|com3	of SonLVL
2018-09-27 18:53:40	djohe|com3	or more
2018-09-27 18:54:23	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> djhoe can you click to pick something on one then paint it on the other?
2018-09-27 18:54:24	+Dick-Cord	*J​orge* Oo
2018-09-27 18:54:26	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> *djohe
2018-09-27 18:54:50	djohe|com3	yes
2018-09-27 18:54:51	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> oh wait, that was the anwser to G4
2018-09-27 18:55:13	djohe|com3	it is called copy paste
2018-09-27 18:55:36	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> yeah but copy paste is a one item "buffer"
2018-09-27 18:56:45	djohe|com3	anyway MainMemory please fix the previous / next button for blocks so it is not just limited to the chunk view... or add more buttons
2018-09-27 18:57:22	djohe|com3	same for tile buttons
2018-09-27 18:57:25	%MainMemory	fix?
2018-09-27 18:57:44	djohe|com3	do I need to make a picture of it?
2018-09-27 18:58:41	%MainMemory	fix implies something is broken, the hotkeys for the chunk editor were never meant to work in the block editor
2018-09-27 18:58:56	%MainMemory	you want me to add something
2018-09-27 19:01:47	djohe|com3	also I can hardly make out the yellow outline of the yellow selection box on the white background in chunk/block/tile vieing
2018-09-27 19:02:00	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> ^this
2018-09-27 19:02:03	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> RED plz
2018-09-27 19:02:29	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> or some primary color that is not the dominant one on the tile/block/thing itself
2018-09-27 19:02:56	djohe|com3	viewing*
2018-09-27 19:03:18	djohe|com3	/selection
2018-09-27 19:04:33	djohe|com3	I have no idea why I never bothered to complain about this workflow when I was reordering tiles for proto CNZ or OOZ
2018-09-27 19:04:45	djohe|com3	or any other zone
2018-09-27 19:05:40	djohe|com3	but it is a damn pain in the arse to constantly switch between tile selection and block selection all the time because there is no previous or next buttons
2018-09-27 19:05:55	djohe|com3	and I can easily get lost in all of the blocks or tiles
2018-09-27 19:10:40	djohe|com3	here is the workflow I have to endure right now:
2018-09-27 19:10:50	djohe|com3	1. select a block in block tab I want to reorder the art tiles in
2018-09-27 19:11:34	djohe|com3	2. go tile tab and reorder the tiles I need to reorder by identifying their ID's in the block
2018-09-27 19:12:24	djohe|com3	3. then when complete with that block go back to block tab and somehow find the one that is selected because selection box is super hard to see
2018-09-27 19:12:40	djohe|com3	and press the one after that
2018-09-27 19:12:48	djohe|com3	then repeat
2018-09-27 19:13:47	djohe|com3	all of this because no prev or next buttons/hotkeys
2018-09-27 19:14:31	djohe|com3	MainMemory^
2018-09-27 19:22:23	%MainMemory	you could just write them down and use the advanced remapping dialog to do them all at once
2018-09-27 19:22:42	djohe|com3	no I can not
2018-09-27 19:23:06	djohe|com3	I do not want to reorder all tiles neither do I want to reorder the same tiles in all blocks
2018-09-27 19:23:44	%MainMemory	huh?
2018-09-27 19:24:46	djohe|com3	the manual process of the reordering is not my issue here, the user unfriendliness of SonLVL is the issue here with hard to see yellow on white outline and no buttons/hotkeys
2018-09-27 19:25:44	%MainMemory	...
2018-09-27 19:25:49	%MainMemory	um
2018-09-27 19:26:06	%MainMemory	have you read the readme
2018-09-27 19:26:26	%MainMemory	because I just did, and, "Page Up, Page Down, Home, End: Change current block."
2018-09-27 19:26:44	djohe|com3	you are contradicting yourself

2018-09-27 19:26:46	djohe|com3	[19:44:39] <%MainMemory> I don't think so
2018-09-27 19:26:58	%MainMemory	that's not a contradiction
2018-09-27 19:27:06	%MainMemory	I never said it absolutely doesn't
2018-09-27 19:27:15	%MainMemory	I was incorrect
2018-09-27 19:27:42	%MainMemory	do you really expect me to remember every hotkey in a program I rarely use
2018-09-27 19:27:53	djohe|com3	why is there no offline manual for SonLVL
2018-09-27 19:27:59	djohe|com3	included
2018-09-27 19:28:05	%MainMemory	because there's barely an online one
2018-09-27 19:28:21	djohe|com3	then how the fuck do you expect me to read the readme
2018-09-27 19:28:26	djohe|com3	lol
2018-09-27 19:28:27	%MainMemory	it's included
2018-09-27 19:28:45	%MainMemory	it's right in the help menu
2018-09-27 19:29:08	djohe|com3	lol that one....
2018-09-27 19:29:18	djohe|com3	you should not have it say readme
2018-09-27 19:29:24	djohe|com3	readme is just readme....
2018-09-27 19:29:34	djohe|com3	in my eyes it should say manual
2018-09-27 19:29:39	%MainMemory	it's not a manual
2018-09-27 19:30:52	djohe|com3	you still need to fix the yellow on white outline BS tho and add buttons for those that do not read the readme
2018-09-27 19:31:10	%MainMemory	buttons?
2018-09-27 19:31:14	djohe|com3	should not be limited to hotkeys
2018-09-27 19:31:22	djohe|com3	the pageup and down
2018-09-27 19:31:26	djohe|com3	hotkeys
2018-09-27 19:31:35	djohe|com3	should also have buttons in UI
2018-09-27 19:31:50	%MainMemory	first you complain there aren't any hotkeys, now you complain that you want buttons
2018-09-27 19:32:10	djohe|com3	I do yes
2018-09-27 19:32:22	djohe|com3	it should be both
2018-09-27 19:32:41	djohe|com3	like SonED2

2018-09-27 19:32:57	%MainMemory	soned2 doesn't have any buttons
2018-09-27 19:33:09	djohe|com3	except it does
2018-09-27 19:33:12	%MainMemory	tiny arrows hardly count as buttons
2018-09-27 19:33:20	djohe|com3	it has those super tiny arrow buttons
2018-09-27 19:33:54	djohe|com3	and so does even SonLVL but not for that task
2018-09-27 19:34:23	%MainMemory	what, the number boxes?

2018-09-28 19:33:41	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> well need to have the sprite tiles matching a 8x16 boundary
2018-09-28 19:33:51	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> otherwise it's not harder than normal
2018-09-28 19:34:13	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> I mean I dunno what djohe's results are in terms of vram utilization % by ARz
2018-09-28 19:34:19	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> 120% or something maybe
2018-09-28 19:34:29	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> or mabe 150
2018-09-28 19:34:41	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> (2P)
2018-09-28 19:35:47	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Since the platforms rely on specific ordering of the tiles in the level, making them after shuffling all the tiles around will likely require wasting excessive amounts of sprite pieces. Or just copying the artwork to free VRAM, but that also poses problems, like clearing said VRAM.
2018-09-28 19:36:33	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> Pacca but said tile arrangement is probably similar/same to what a couple of 16x16s would use
2018-09-28 19:37:12	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> the platforme would be the one defining the tile ordering because of the way sprites work
2018-09-28 19:38:03	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Fair enough. I don't know much about conversion for 2 player, but I do know that shuffling level tiles around can scramble the platform art work, since it reuses the level art.
2018-09-28 19:38:34	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> conversion for 2P is very simple... in concept
2018-09-28 19:38:42	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> tiles become 8x16
2018-09-28 19:39:02	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> and it's good to have a 16x16 tile arrangement that is
2018-09-28 19:39:20	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> 00 02
2018-09-28 19:39:23	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> 01 03
2018-09-28 19:39:56	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> so on 2P said 16x16 would be 00 01
2018-09-28 19:40:11	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> you need 3 plane tables
2018-09-28 19:40:37	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> one for 1P FG, another for 2P FG and the third for a shared BG layer
2018-09-28 19:40:59	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> said BG layer doesn't reload any art (IIRC) or scroll very far
2018-09-28 19:41:26	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> sprite table is overwritten in the HBI so it's all good
2018-09-28 19:41:41	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> water doesn't work (normally) but I was able to make this work in the past
2018-09-28 19:42:39	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> That makes sense. SonLVLs' 2p editor makes the tile shenanigans pretty clear. I've seen water not work myself though, S2 normally has a check specifically designed to prevent it from loading because of how wacky and unstable it can be
2018-09-28 19:43:19	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> nono it's just a horizontal interrupt "problem"
2018-09-28 19:43:33	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> S2's either loads water colors or handles 2P on HBI
2018-09-28 19:43:35	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> not both
2018-09-28 19:44:05	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> worst case you need to run HBI 3 times if both players have water visible and are not fully submerged
2018-09-28 19:44:35	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Ah, that makes sense. Interrupts and VDP stuff are still a bit fuzzy for me though, I only have a general understanding of them
2018-09-28 19:46:07	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> here's a screenshot that I made longass time ago

2018-09-28 19:46:36	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> now it doesn't work anymore because I rewrote some related stuff and broke it
2018-09-28 19:47:49	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> CPz is horrendous in 2P though: not enough space for art, too complex BG and too many objects in many level "slices" and also the water rising event which is not really fair
2018-09-28 19:48:40	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Yeah, there's absolutely no space at all. I once tried to fit some SCD fish artwork in, but I couldn't find space for 4 measly tiles
2018-09-28 19:52:27	%MainMemory	I wonder how hard it would be to make both players have independent water levels
2018-09-28 19:55:56	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> On the object side, you could just make Sonic and Tails check different ram address, like they do with many other attributes they have. And given that water is already being rendered separately on screen, that wouldn't be a problem either. Furthermore, having a 2p level events routine that runs separately for Sonic and Tails would be an easy copy/paste job. The biggest issue might actually be based on the players reaction;
2018-09-28 19:55:57	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca>  that could lead to points were one player is submerged and another isn't, which some players might see as a game balance issue
2018-09-28 19:56:02	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> MM well, just need some extra variables I think
2018-09-28 19:56:27	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> so I think all things considered... the least of the issues
2018-09-28 19:57:22	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> kinda strange having both players in a similar location where one is submerged while the other isn't... yet
2018-09-28 19:57:28	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> yeah kinda what Pacca said
2018-09-28 20:02:32	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> stuff would be easier if the MD came with 128k as originally intended
2018-09-28 20:04:37	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Oh my gosh, it'd be great to have so much extra VRAM. Of course, the original games would have likely eaten up some of that if not all had it been there from the start, but it'd be nice regardless
2018-09-28 20:05:22	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> it's also 2 times faster BTW
2018-09-28 20:05:32	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> well almost 2x
2018-09-28 20:15:36	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> "worst case you need to run HBI 3 times if both players have water visible and are not fully submerged"
2018-09-28 20:15:54	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> 2P in Sonic 2 sounds very intricate.
2018-09-28 20:16:10	%MainMemory	I'd like at least 8 palette lines
2018-09-28 20:16:14	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> I completely understand why this is necessary, but still.
2018-09-28 20:17:40	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> I think the MD could've benefited from more than 512 colours. Or at the very least, somewhat better sound capabilities.
2018-09-28 20:17:55	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> With that many palette lines there basically would be no color limitations at all, besides the limited colors themselves. You could have a separate pallete line for basically every other thing in the level :derpsonic:

2018-09-28 20:20:15	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> and?
2018-09-28 20:20:21	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> the snes came 2 years later

2018-09-28 20:23:37	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> yeah, and it wasn't quite as fast as the Genesis, if I recall correctly
2018-09-28 20:23:38	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> It supports multichannel PCM, that's pretty cool in my book

2018-09-28 21:10:04	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Sonic 3 and S&K are both 2, so that they can combine to make a 4MB rom

2018-09-28 21:10:35	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> Lock-On Technology sure is neato
2018-09-28 21:11:45	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> It's basically the equivalent of opening both roms in a text editor and pasteing the data of one after another, with the exception of the rom swapping stuff for Sonic 2, which otherwise works much the same way

2018-09-28 21:12:58	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> :shh:
2018-09-28 21:13:01	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> If I could, I'd probably just use Lock-On Technology for some sort of Easter egg.
2018-09-28 21:13:25	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Same here ␤Knuckles in Ristar, lol
2018-09-28 21:13:40	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Never will happen from me tho
2018-09-28 21:13:44	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Lock on is easy, just check to see if data exists past the end of your rom, and ensure that it's what your looking for, in the right place.
2018-09-28 21:13:51	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> neat
2018-09-28 21:13:56	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Lock-On Technology would be nice in SMS/Game Gear Sonic games runs

2018-09-28 21:14:26	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Ok, go back to making SMPS
2018-09-28 21:14:30	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Again, it's basically just slapping both roms on top of each other, all locked on data is accessed just like anything else in the rom
2018-09-28 21:14:37	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Kilo> Your brain is too good for this kind of stuff.
2018-09-28 21:15:40	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> yeah but nobody is combining "roms"
2018-09-28 21:15:48	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> would be cool if everybody would play with carts
2018-09-28 21:16:05	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> but with roms, might as well don't give a shit and distribute the thing as it meant to be
2018-09-28 21:16:13	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> @Pacca I'd probably use Lock-On to see if a certain game is running over it, and to load a simple screen with a crude drawing, and it just stays on that screen forever, otherwise either game loads on its own, or something like that
2018-09-28 21:16:16	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> S&K was the way it was because it was just the missing part of S3
2018-09-28 21:16:39	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> It'd be great if someone built a cart with lock-on support preinstalled, even if it was just to play with the blue spheres options in S&K
2018-09-28 21:16:55	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> indeed
2018-09-28 21:16:56	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> then binary is limited to 2MB
2018-09-28 21:17:04	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> kinda shit imo
2018-09-28 21:17:20	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> I'm the Blue Spheres guy :derpsonic:
2018-09-28 21:17:57	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Blue Balls sorry
2018-09-28 21:17:58	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> Yeah, especially in KiS2/S3Ks scenario, where the locked on data is it's own game. So much space wasted to useless, offset code, most if which is copied into S&Ks roms
2018-09-28 21:18:17	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> This is why bank switching is better :derpsonic:
2018-09-28 21:18:24	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> @LordXernom beta S3
2018-09-28 21:18:26	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> not really much space is wasted
2018-09-28 21:18:31	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> sonic art yes sure
2018-09-28 21:18:32	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Yeah
2018-09-28 21:18:44	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> object code for S3 objects yeah, but this is only a few kilobytes
2018-09-28 21:19:27	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> S3 includes a tiny bit of knucks art, but it's also partially exclusive to S3 (laughing, bomb throwing)
2018-09-28 21:19:33	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> @LordXernom I may do a simple cheat for a S3 mini hack that changes the text for the beginning a Special Stage to "GET BLUE BALLS" like in the beta, y'know, for "funsies"
2018-09-28 21:19:43	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Nice!
2018-09-28 21:20:01	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> There's also little duplicated things like the EoL art, special stage assets, etc
2018-09-28 21:20:25	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> I think the hardest part of it would be coming up with a good cheat code.
2018-09-28 21:20:37	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> yeah little things but come on
2018-09-28 21:20:53	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> we're talking qbout a few kilobytes at best
2018-09-28 21:20:54	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> should it be a button combo on the title screen? or a sound test cheat? this stuff matters to me
2018-09-28 21:21:15	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> I still need to make a custom cheat code for S2CDRs' debug, now that the options screen has been completely reworked
2018-09-28 21:21:25	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> I didn't tried cheat codes yet, but messed a little with art and layout inside S3 with crappy results
2018-09-28 21:21:56	+Dick-Cord	<★​maple t★> I changed the cheats for my S2 rom hack, but they're meaningless, and not very tricky
2018-09-28 21:22:07	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> you also can't edit S3 levels and lock into S&K
2018-09-28 21:22:18	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> the latter will override the object locations
2018-09-28 21:23:01	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> Sonic & Knuckles has Sonic 3 essentially in it's core.
2018-09-28 21:23:40	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> without tails, without sram, without levels, without competition
2018-09-28 21:23:48	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> I found CNZ easiest to edit, majority of the zones are scripting hell imo
2018-09-28 21:23:55	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> All that Sonic & Knuckles uses in the upper space if Sonic 3 is plugged in is it's data.
2018-09-28 21:24:07	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> what else could it use?
2018-09-28 21:24:38	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> code? yeah if it has no absolute addressing then yeah, but they probably didn't think of this thoughly
2018-09-28 21:24:54	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> or same variable addresses
2018-09-28 21:24:55	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> The only thing S&K does have tails object code
2018-09-28 21:25:03	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> Don't forget that most RAM in S&K was shifted around majorly.
2018-09-28 21:25:16	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> yes it shifted,m but they didn't really need to shift it
2018-09-28 21:26:42	+Dick-Cord	<K​az> Then create a time travel machine made with your best FPGA and go back to 1993 and get yourself hired on Sonic Team as a programmer.
2018-09-28 21:26:56	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> I don't like to program for a living lol
2018-09-28 21:27:14	+Dick-Cord	<J​orge> I could have made an awesome cart, but not the game 😄

2018-09-30 15:24:26	ValleyBell	I've been porting something from AS to ASM68k, and I had this code block:
2018-09-30 15:24:27	ValleyBell		if ResumeNote == 0
2018-09-30 15:24:28	ValleyBell			bset	#1,$00(a5)	; Set track at rest bit
2018-09-30 15:24:29	ValleyBell		endif
2018-09-30 15:24:49	ValleyBell	I also had "if ResumeNote == 1" at another place
2018-09-30 15:25:30	ValleyBell	I set "ResumeNote = 0" at the beginning, but none of the blocks ended up in the ROM.
2018-09-30 15:26:07	ValleyBell	It is very picky about spaces here and it doesn't complain, but instead just silently ignores the whole if-block.
2018-09-30 15:26:45	ValleyBell	Meanwhile I figured it out that the correct syntax is "if ResumeNote=0"

2018-09-30 15:29:55	ValleyBell	Any suggestions?
2018-09-30 15:32:59	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> oh the reason probably is, that asm68k is reading that if ResumeNote as itself and is using that to decide whether to run it or not
2018-09-30 15:33:38	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> can you show an example usage ValleyBell
2018-09-30 15:34:39	ValleyBell	For the macro, it's:

2018-09-30 15:36:43	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Is sound effect editing similar to FM instrument/SMPS editing?
2018-09-30 15:36:45	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I learned this the hard way while making my own moveq thing
2018-09-30 15:37:13	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> though, iirc Clownacy has a 'fixed' version of ASM68K that will accept non-sign-extended moveq values
2018-09-30 15:37:22	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> oh also, why not just sign-extend here anyway

2018-09-30 15:43:55	+Dick-Cord	<P​acca> SFX are basically just stripped down SMPS songs at heart. They have a different header format because SFX usually don't need to use all the channels, but pretty much everything else is identical, as far as I've seen. They accept the same voices/instruments and use the same format for giving sound driver commands.
2018-09-30 15:47:29	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yes SFX themselves are basically just music that work slightly differently and have few different rules
2018-09-30 15:47:38	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> but as far as the composer is concerned, much isnt changed
2018-09-30 15:55:23	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> So theoretically, I can edit them in an FM instrument editor?

2018-09-30 17:00:48	ValleyBell	I wanted to work on mid2smps a bit anyway.
2018-09-30 17:06:43	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> ValleyBell can you add a /m into the asm68k commandline and opt m+ somewhere before that macro and see if anything weird is in the listings file?
2018-09-30 17:09:43	ValleyBell	one moment ...
2018-09-30 17:14:24	ValleyBell	oh, that's interesting - just adding the /m option makes it appear in the .lst file
2018-09-30 17:14:53	ValleyBell	and ... apparently it put the stuff into the ROM before. It just omitted it from the listing file at all.
2018-09-30 17:15:11	ValleyBell	0007FB9C 7002                       		moveq	#$02, d0
2018-09-30 17:15:12	ValleyBell	0007FBA6                            
2018-09-30 17:15:13	ValleyBell	0007FBA6                            ; end of 'ROM'
2018-09-30 17:18:07	ValleyBell	I had some trouble with the if-block syntax at first, so maybe that was the reason things were missing at first. And I didn't notice that it would work, because it just didn't show the macros in the .lst file.
2018-09-30 17:21:49	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Oh yea
2018-09-30 17:22:02	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Asm68k likes omitting stuff from the listings file
2018-09-30 17:22:11	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> Quite annoying 'feature'
2018-09-30 17:22:16	ValleyBell	indeed
2018-09-30 17:22:41	ValleyBell	Okay, so that solves my main problem, neat. Thanks.

2018-09-30 17:23:29	ValleyBell	ASM68k not liking whitespace is probably another "feature"
2018-09-30 17:23:50	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> hah yeah....
2018-09-30 17:25:04	ValleyBell	It's especially annoying when you port back from AS.
2018-09-30 17:25:54	ValleyBell	because it just stops at the first space and ignores the rest
2018-09-30 17:25:57	ValleyBell	silently
2018-09-30 17:26:14	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yep
2018-09-30 17:26:33	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> no idea why they would do that
2018-09-30 17:26:39	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> it seems to be the case for a lot of things too
2018-09-30 17:26:50	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like dc.b 0 0 will only write 1 byte

2018-09-30 17:27:02	ValleyBell	yeah
2018-09-30 17:27:12	ValleyBell	tl;dr: Both ASM68k and AS have their flaws
2018-09-30 17:27:36	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> agreed
2018-09-30 17:27:42	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> yea
2018-09-30 17:28:02	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> I'd like to think flaws in asm68k are more annoying than about being completely broken lol
2018-09-30 17:29:18	ValleyBell	It's probably just being more familiar with one or another.
2018-09-30 17:29:40	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> to a part yeah, but some bugs in AS makes it sometimes borderline useless
2018-09-30 17:29:55	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> like not being able to assemble valid code :V

2018-09-30 20:12:53	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> to ValleyBell if he's still here: is there an effective way to convert the pitch values seen in SMPSPlay DAC inis to Hz?
2018-09-30 20:14:32	ValleyBell	I can paste the formula.
2018-09-30 20:15:00	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> much appreciated
2018-09-30 20:15:17	djohe|com3	ValleyBell when do we get more SPA hax
2018-09-30 20:16:41	ValleyBell	SMPSPlay formula:	Hz = BaseRate / (DACDivider + x)
2018-09-30 20:16:42	ValleyBell	via Z80 cycles:	Hz = 3579545 * LoopSmpls / (BaseCycles + LoopCycles * (x-1))
2018-09-30 20:17:15	ValleyBell	djohe|com3: Whenever I get myself to start hacking again.
2018-09-30 20:18:14	ValleyBell	@A​kumaYin: The first formula uses the "BaseRate" and "RateDiv" values. x is the "Rate" value of the DAC sample.
2018-09-30 20:18:27	ValleyBell	However that's slighly less accurate than the second formula.
2018-09-30 20:18:43	ValleyBell	which uses BaseCycles/LoopCycles/LoopSamples from the DAC.ini files
2018-09-30 20:18:51	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> all right, thanks
2018-09-30 20:19:16	ValleyBell	I'll just do a quick example. Sonic 1 has: BaseCycles = 301, LoopCycles = 26, LoopSamples = 2
2018-09-30 20:19:37	ValleyBell	The kick drum plays with rate 0x17 (hex) / 23 (decimal)
2018-09-30 20:20:58	ValleyBell	So the formula is: 3579545 * 2 / (301 + 26 * (23-1)) = 8200.56 Hz
2018-09-30 20:22:41	ValleyBell	I just had the nice idea of making a tiny DAC rate caluclator.
2018-09-30 20:22:54	ValleyBell	(just can't be bothered to do it right now)

2018-09-30 23:05:36	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> I am finally home, joy.
2018-09-30 23:07:23	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> So, how does one use SMPS2ASM?
2018-09-30 23:09:07	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> I can't seen to get it to work.
2018-09-30 23:12:47	+Dick-Cord	<h​.carrell the maker of sp> idk
2018-09-30 23:14:51	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> speaking of DAC, been planning to make a whole pack for them primarily for general use (original rate and then upsampled to 44.1kHz with no interpolation). Starting off with SMPS since those will be the easier ones to get the Hz from. Finding the rates for non-SMPS OSTs will take time but worth in the end.
2018-09-30 23:15:27	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> Since the biggest pack out there for general use of genesis pcm are just straight up recorded from foobar currently
2018-09-30 23:15:52	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> the Mixer P pack?
2018-09-30 23:15:55	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> ye
2018-09-30 23:15:59	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> already talked to him about it
2018-09-30 23:16:38	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> yeah, a bunch of them are butchered because they're just recorded
2018-09-30 23:16:50	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> plus it's missing some game's samples, and some aren't even samples at all
2018-09-30 23:17:26	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> in the end priority is ROM > VGM > Recording (aiming to never do this one though)
2018-09-30 23:17:34	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> yeah
2018-09-30 23:17:51	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> he's down for it but the issue for him is time so it's probably better if it was a group effort
2018-09-30 23:17:58	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> Raijin already started before with some SMPS games
2018-09-30 23:18:17	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> speaking of Rajin tho

2018-09-30 23:20:07	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> one of the best out there honestly
2018-09-30 23:20:38	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> he's somewhat of a perfectionist when it comes to FM sound design
2018-09-30 23:20:39	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> right up there with Gecko Yamori and amphobius
2018-09-30 23:21:32	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> speaking of gecko, he recently did a really good cover of battlefield from Golden Axe
2018-09-30 23:21:39	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> There's the FM, and then the samples are really clean and slick, which boosts the overall quality
2018-09-30 23:21:50	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> he hasn't uploaded it yet on yt but gave out a vgm early
2018-09-30 23:21:53	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> on this fm server
2018-09-30 23:23:44	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> bit sad though that the neo geo port of Xeno Crisis is gonna just have the genesis music streamed thru ADPCM because of the lack of good tools for it
2018-09-30 23:23:53	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> in terms of it in general
2018-09-30 23:24:27	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> and speak of the devfil
2018-09-30 23:24:32	ValleyBell	@O​zaleto: I think I would prefer having WAVs at the original sample rate.
2018-09-30 23:25:08	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> the issue with that is that modern DAWs don't have options for interpolation
2018-09-30 23:25:14	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> as in
2018-09-30 23:25:22	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> it does one automatically and you can't change how it handles it
2018-09-30 23:25:23	ValleyBell	aww, well, okay then
2018-09-30 23:25:32	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> well I think Ableton can but I know FL can't?
2018-09-30 23:25:39	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> but we put the original sample rate in the file's name
2018-09-30 23:26:09	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> also speak of the devil of that battlefield cover I talked about

2018-09-30 23:26:24	ValleyBell	Maybe you could release one pack with the original sample rate and another one with "DAW compatible" ones?
2018-09-30 23:27:06	ValleyBell	The "original sample rate" pack would be nice for people that want to put them into ROM hacks.
2018-09-30 23:27:44	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> well the other issue is that DefleMask doesn't support arbitrary sample rates (only preset ones), but I can still do that in the end for ROM Hackers
2018-09-30 23:28:26	ValleyBell	Has there been any work on DefleMask recently, btw?
2018-09-30 23:28:40	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> behind the scenes, seems like he's pushing for a big v13 release
2018-09-30 23:28:44	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> supposedly an actual playback routine

2018-09-30 23:32:14	ValleyBell	I started to work on it yesterday, so I want to post at least something.
2018-09-30 23:32:24	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> I've been focusing doing genesis stuff on DefleMask much more now
2018-09-30 23:32:29	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> I could attempt but no gurantees
2018-09-30 23:33:04	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> I've covered this song twice in the past actually, but both times were over three years ago so I suppose it's an opportunity to make something better
2018-09-30 23:35:21	ValleyBell	I never got myself into using any sort of tracker but OpenMPT.
2018-09-30 23:35:38	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> OpenMPT is pretty great
2018-09-30 23:35:51	ValleyBell	and even OpenMPT I use mainly to do prototyping.

2018-09-30 23:40:50	ValleyBell	sounds like 8 KHz or so
2018-09-30 23:41:18	ValleyBell	else it's a pretty nice MegaDrive version
2018-09-30 23:41:23	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> could be yeah, but I was lazy and went with the one used in Phantasy Star IV
2018-09-30 23:41:29	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> thanks
2018-09-30 23:41:49	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> it's also a pain when deflemask doesn't support software pitch control
2018-09-30 23:41:56	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> to have different pitches = different samples
2018-09-30 23:42:23	+Dick-Cord	<o​erg866> @Jorge um... very yes?
2018-09-30 23:42:28	ValleyBell	oh yeah, PS4 is a bad choice regarding sample quality
2018-09-30 23:42:41	ValleyBell	They're all between 4 and 8 KHz or so

2018-09-30 23:46:22	ValleyBell	MML to SMPS might actually be quite possible.
2018-09-30 23:46:56	ValleyBell	For DefleMask to SMPS, converting all the effects might be difficult.
2018-09-30 23:48:00	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> It would be, but not all effects are truly necessary
2018-09-30 23:48:29	ValleyBell	Converting PSG would probably problematic.
2018-09-30 23:48:47	ValleyBell	due to fixed PSG envelopes
2018-09-30 23:49:13	ValleyBell	I just wonder ... DefleMask -> MIDI -> SMPS?
2018-09-30 23:49:25	ValleyBell	that would be funny
2018-09-30 23:49:41	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> dmf2midi2smps would just make it a bit more complicated

2018-10-01 00:18:02	~Spanner	<divingkatae> It's just that developers didn't constantly update it.

2018-10-01 17:44:43	ValleyBell	Does anyone feel like volunteering for mid2smps beta testing?
2018-10-01 17:46:27	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> If I can get my hands on a gyb file, sure.
2018-10-01 17:48:30	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> gyb files aren't publicly distributed banks, they're specifically for mid2smps and are designed for storing and mapping instruments to midi patches for the conversion
2018-10-01 17:50:03	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> you can rip instruments from vgm files with 2612edit, which is how I obtain most of mine
2018-10-01 17:56:15	ValleyBell	I'm compiling the archive right now ...
2018-10-01 17:57:19	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> Are there any new features in particular that you're wanting tested?
2018-10-01 17:58:23	ValleyBell	It's mostly bugfixes and stuff, but there are indeed a few new features.
2018-10-01 17:58:52	ValleyBell	I added options to disable the Chorus controller and Pan Law Compensation.
2018-10-01 17:59:09	ValleyBell	and global loop markers
2018-10-01 17:59:24	ValleyBell	using "Marker Events" (i.e. Winamp/foobar compatible)
2018-10-01 18:00:03	ValleyBell	also GYB files support 32000 instruments now and you can use Bank MSB/LSB to select them
2018-10-01 18:02:03	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> adding support for loop markers sounds useful for sure
2018-10-01 18:02:28	ValleyBell	The old channel-based loop marker still work, of cours.

2018-10-01 18:12:31	ValleyBell	oh, a small warning:
2018-10-01 18:12:45	ValleyBell	The new mid2smps writes GYB v3.
2018-10-01 18:13:13	ValleyBell	The old mid2smps/2612edit/MIDI driver can't work with GYB v3 files.
2018-10-01 18:13:41	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> good to know, I'll keep that in mind
2018-10-01 18:13:52	ValleyBell	If you update mid2smps, you should update all the other tools as well.
2018-10-01 18:14:07	ValleyBell	The MIDI driver should be more stable than the 2013 version anyway.
2018-10-01 18:14:33	ValleyBell	*The new MIDI driver
2018-10-01 18:32:52	ValleyBell	@A​kumaYin: When you have time, could you check whether or not the new MIDI driver crashes when run as user in Win10?
2018-10-01 18:34:38	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> I'll try to get to that sometime this week
2018-10-01 18:36:17	ValleyBell	I think the main feature of the "new" mid2smps is support for Bank MSB/LSB.
2018-10-01 18:36:39	ValleyBell	and thus being able to use more than 128 instruments per GYB file
2018-10-01 18:37:42	ValleyBell	The feature has been present in "beta" builds I posted here previously, though.

2018-10-01 20:37:28	ValleyBell	But for doing proper music you need to get more decent instruments.

2018-10-01 20:43:31	ValleyBell	When you import instruments, keep in mind that you might have to normalize them.
2018-10-01 20:43:36	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> ^
2018-10-01 20:43:50	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> You can also find some instruments inside VOPM opl pack.
2018-10-01 20:44:02	ValleyBell	Especially instruments from VGMs (maybe TFIs exported from VGMs as well?) are often too quiet.
2018-10-01 20:44:06	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> I've noticed that instruments imported from vgm files are almost always muted when you go to use them, so normalizing them whenever importing is good practice.

2018-10-01 20:44:35	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> it depends on the vgm
2018-10-01 20:44:36	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> I mean
2018-10-01 20:44:41	ValleyBell	It does, yeah.
2018-10-01 20:44:56	ValleyBell	The dumped instrument is as loud as the loudest note played by the song.
2018-10-01 20:44:57	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> every composer had their own way of normalizing
2018-10-01 20:44:59	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> well I've heard it happen with every vgm I've imported from
2018-10-01 20:45:24	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> with the ym2612, it's so loud compared to the other FM chips really
2018-10-01 20:45:36	ValleyBell	And especially when you combine FM with DAC or PSG, I usually have instruments playing at -6db or quieter.
2018-10-01 20:45:50	ValleyBell	(-6 db = TL 8)
2018-10-01 20:46:26	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> for DAC you can technically just amplify before importing but PSG obviously you can't do anything in terms of volume there if the max isn't loud enough
2018-10-01 20:46:39	ValleyBell	Actually, mid2smps has the maximum FM volume set to TL 8. (You can get around that using the Chorus controller.)

2018-10-01 20:48:03	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> might as well release something earlier than I should be releasing to showcase how loud the ym2612 can be lmao
2018-10-01 20:48:37	ValleyBell	Castlevania Bloodlines often plays pretty loud.
2018-10-01 20:49:01	ValleyBell	In fact it's so loud that it clips with VGMPlay/in_vgm with volume set to 100%.
2018-10-01 20:49:16	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> If any of you are interested, here's my instrument file.

2018-10-01 20:49:22	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> All the instruments are custom made.
2018-10-01 20:49:50	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Oh my... XD What a odd results @Iso Killo  Din't imagine that trying that way lol
2018-10-01 20:50:17	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Now to try PA's gyb file
2018-10-01 20:50:34	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Like I said, most of the instruments are guitars/brass.
2018-10-01 20:51:07	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> And the basses are slap.
2018-10-01 20:51:12	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> And one synth bass.
2018-10-01 20:51:13	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> That's fine it is TSR's main theme, AKA Crush 40
2018-10-01 20:51:35	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Yeah, one of my recent sequences :V
2018-10-01 20:52:04	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> It sounded good and I thought I'd get the same results as you. ␤I was wrong ␤Very wrong
2018-10-01 20:52:16	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Rom?
2018-10-01 20:52:53	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> That was just for experimentation sake for most weird FM instruments I could pul off years ago.

2018-10-01 20:53:23	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> alright
2018-10-01 20:53:24	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> found it
2018-10-01 20:53:44	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> it's a cover of a song that my friend wrote for a fangame (which is now gonna be released on an album later)
2018-10-01 20:53:48	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> I went full on loud here
2018-10-01 20:54:59	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> So uh ␤PA's gyb file just doesn't work with most channels. A lot of them are broken except for like 2.
2018-10-01 20:55:07	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> MIDI2SMPS Instrument Editor, sometimes VOPM, didn't tried Deflemask yet, because for Tracker format I prefer samples over FM. @PineappleArse
2018-10-01 20:55:11	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Or 3
2018-10-01 20:55:14	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> May you send the rom?

2018-10-01 20:55:36	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> was done in defle
2018-10-01 20:55:39	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> Did you load the gyb into mid2smps itself, and not just the editor?
2018-10-01 20:55:40	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> I use deffelmask because of it's instrument editor.

2018-10-01 20:55:57	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Then I transcrive the values into Mid2SMPS.
2018-10-01 20:56:24	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> If anyone's got some gyb files they want me to try, just send em to me and yeah.
2018-10-01 20:56:29	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> I load .gyb files, but also editing them, because imported/created presets has volume issues
2018-10-01 20:56:48	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Too loud, sometimes too silent
2018-10-01 20:56:59	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> @Iso Killo Send me the Midi file.
2018-10-01 20:57:09	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> I think I know the problem
2018-10-01 20:57:14	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> I need check every patch every time to make sure
2018-10-01 20:57:35	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> You can find it on the music thread on SSRG, it's actually Xernom's, I was just testing Mid2Smps out.
2018-10-01 20:57:48	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Did you change anything to the midi?
2018-10-01 20:57:59	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> No
2018-10-01 20:58:03	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> I think?
2018-10-01 20:58:04	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> That's why.
2018-10-01 20:58:06	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Ah
2018-10-01 20:58:30	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Which one is it? The South Island one?
2018-10-01 20:58:34	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> I've sequenced it with Genesis limitations in mind, but editing is always needed imo.
2018-10-01 20:59:31	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Well now that I have a basic grasp of how to use Mid2Smps, and 2 gyb files (Lord, you're fine with me using yours, right?) I just need to find a composer for my hack. Hrm ␤CQ's kind of busy...
2018-10-01 20:59:43	ValleyBell	You'll have to edit 99% of all MIDIs in order to make it convert properly.
2018-10-01 20:59:55	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Yeah. Especially that TSR one uses pitch bends and other events crap.
2018-10-01 20:59:55	ValleyBell	It uses fixed channel mappings for MIDI -> SMPS.
2018-10-01 21:00:11	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> You could learn to compose music for yourself
2018-10-01 21:00:15	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> ^
2018-10-01 21:00:29	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> I always found composing more fun tho
2018-10-01 21:00:35	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> that's usually more effective than trying to find others who are willing to do it for you, even if it takes more time
2018-10-01 21:00:47	ValleyBell	I find it easier to port songs due to my lack of creativity.

2018-10-01 21:03:01	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> For me sequencing via ears can be pain, I dislike editing other midis, because I found it more troublesome if they're sequenced without Genesis limitations in mind and drum channels often needs total cleansing in order to work properly.
2018-10-01 21:03:21	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Thanks Valley!
2018-10-01 21:03:42	ValleyBell	I need to admit I often spend a few hours fitting a MIDI into 9-10 monophonic channels.

2018-10-01 21:04:33	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Oh. That synth bass totally encompasses the slap bass.

2018-10-01 21:07:07	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Sequencing it or editing can be pain with SA3
2018-10-01 21:07:27	ValleyBell	I made it even worse by using Teck's (awesome) arrangements as a base.

2018-10-01 21:08:22	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> That's why I avoid searching for midis, even that my ears also have habit to miss few notes.

2018-10-01 21:09:15	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Hold on, does MID2SMPS support Dual PCM?
2018-10-01 21:09:22	ValleyBell	nope, it doesn't
2018-10-01 21:09:23	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> no
2018-10-01 21:09:24	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Oof
2018-10-01 21:09:29	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> note to others, don't expect MIDIs on Teck's twitter lmao
2018-10-01 21:09:30	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> you have to do that yourself
2018-10-01 21:09:34	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> there's a lot of something else
2018-10-01 21:09:36	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> there
2018-10-01 21:09:42	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> ~~There's an idea for ya' Valley~~
2018-10-01 21:11:00	ValleyBell	I have not a single good idea of I could handle 2 DAC channels.
2018-10-01 21:11:19	ValleyBell	This begins with the concept of how you distribute the notes to them.
2018-10-01 21:11:20	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> on top of software pitch and volume control
2018-10-01 21:11:35	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> ch 15 and 16 are used at all for mid2smps?
2018-10-01 21:11:47	ValleyBell	They aren't no.
2018-10-01 21:12:28	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> You could use those two for the channels then
2018-10-01 21:12:38	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Dual PCM have potential for new music genres lol having bad idea about Genesiscore, FM mixed with distorted vocals and real guitars etc.
2018-10-01 21:12:39	ValleyBell	There is a hidden "PWM" mode.
2018-10-01 21:12:51	ValleyBell	that uses channels 7-9 for PWM 2-4
2018-10-01 21:13:08	ValleyBell	but it's really hackish
2018-10-01 21:13:41	ValleyBell	and it doesn't support volume/pitch control
2018-10-01 21:13:58	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Anyways, uh. The reason why I'm trying to learn about SMPS stuff is for a huge, ambitious project I have. I'm trying to turn Sonic 1 into osu!, which sounds dumb and too difficult for me, but I've spent the past few months thinking it through.
2018-10-01 21:14:12	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> ...
2018-10-01 21:14:20	ValleyBell	actually - can someone remind me how DualPCM's pitch is controlled on the SMPS side?
2018-10-01 21:14:29	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> @Miss Fox hello
2018-10-01 21:14:38	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> how would osu! work on the MD?
2018-10-01 21:14:52	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> You can just experiment with it first just for fun. Then you could try more later.
2018-10-01 21:15:17	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> if you read this natsumi, check valley's question
2018-10-01 21:15:39	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Um... How do I explain how I'd get osu! to work without describing every little detail...

2018-10-01 21:15:52	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> hello
2018-10-01 21:15:57	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> No go on, no need to correct yourself
2018-10-01 21:15:58	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> lmao
2018-10-01 21:16:02	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> DualPCM does not have pitch control on the released version right?
2018-10-01 21:16:06	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> I'm interested.
2018-10-01 21:16:16	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> not in the current version, no
2018-10-01 21:16:58	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> aren't you too young for that iso
2018-10-01 21:17:15	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> (yes)
2018-10-01 21:17:18	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> errr
2018-10-01 21:17:29	+Dick-Cord	<M​iss Fox> not getting involved with minors sorry lol
2018-10-01 21:18:13	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> but anyways
2018-10-01 21:18:18	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Let's see. How do I answer this. ␤So you'd use the controller instead of a mouse/tablet + keyboard. I could try the Sega mouse, but obviously too idiotic for that. And the D-pad would act as a basic cursor, shouldn't be too hard to make a cursor I presume...
2018-10-01 21:18:33	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> seeing as dualpcm doesn't have software pitch and volume control
2018-10-01 21:18:42	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> could wait until dualpcm releases
2018-10-01 21:18:47	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> I don't like this "Sega Mouse" idea
2018-10-01 21:18:51	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> have you seen how precision-based some beatmaps are
2018-10-01 21:18:52	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> also sega mouse no lol
2018-10-01 21:18:56	+Dick-Cord	<A​kumaYin> using a d-pad for it would not work
2018-10-01 21:18:59	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Good, I'm not doing anything with the Sega mouse
2018-10-01 21:19:05	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> ^
2018-10-01 21:19:12	ValleyBell	I doubt I'll work on any major features in mid2smps anyway.
2018-10-01 21:19:33	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> As for the precision of the beat maps, well I'd make it less precise. Maybe have some sort of grid which circles can spawn in.
2018-10-01 21:19:39	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> also ValleyBell, what's the best way to get a sample rate from a sample within a VGM?
2018-10-01 21:19:47	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> Because using a ym2612 debugger is painful
2018-10-01 21:20:08	ValleyBell	The current release is more a "just release what I did over the last few years".
2018-10-01 21:20:13	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> since the value tends to spaz out and becomes well, hard to read
2018-10-01 21:20:17	ValleyBell	umm... that's difficult
2018-10-01 21:20:56	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Each map would also have difficulties, so it's up to them choosing how hard they want it to be. ␤GHZ1 basically being a tutorial, GHZ2 being a standard map while GHZ3 is hard, but not Big Black levels.
2018-10-01 21:21:05	ValleyBell	Unless you have a VGM in version 1.60, it's next to impossible to get the actual sample rate.
2018-10-01 21:21:15	ValleyBell	without writing custom tools
2018-10-01 21:21:41	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> Ah right
2018-10-01 21:21:55	ValleyBell	because the VGM stores PCM writes as "set PCM data = x, then wait X samples, then set PCM data = x, then wait X samples, ..."
2018-10-01 21:21:58	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Why GHZ tho? You could try edit art and stuff to make it like "new/fresh" zone
2018-10-01 21:22:25	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> That's why I'm building off of S1 instead of doing a homebrew, so I have songs and a driver to work with.
2018-10-01 21:22:34	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> I prefer editing zones than remaking them, for one reason, and one reason only.
2018-10-01 21:22:35	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Also so it can go into SHC
2018-10-01 21:22:37	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Collision.
2018-10-01 21:22:40	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> ^^^
2018-10-01 21:22:50	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> I see, the next best thing is doing it by ear (obviously wouldn't be as precise as it can be)
2018-10-01 21:22:52	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> But collision won't matter
2018-10-01 21:23:03	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> but
2018-10-01 21:23:08	ValleyBell	In VGM v1.60 (like the ones exported by DefleMask and sometimes VGM MM), you just need to decompress the VGZ (it's .vgm.gz) and then you search for "92 00 aa bb cc dd"
2018-10-01 21:23:12	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> it's still fine at least
2018-10-01 21:23:27	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Collision matters imo. I feel more control with it during checking that
2018-10-01 21:23:44	ValleyBell	where aa bb cc dd are the 4 bytes describing the frequency in Hz (Little Endian order, i.e reversed)
2018-10-01 21:23:56	ValleyBell	An alternate idea:
2018-10-01 21:24:13	ValleyBell	Make a WAV of the VGM with everything but the DAC channel muted
2018-10-01 21:24:30	ValleyBell	and then adjust the sample rate in Audacity until it matches the VGM
2018-10-01 21:24:37	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Like this, was once MZ. I edited it to not be MZ, but it has the original collision.

2018-10-01 21:24:44	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Nice!
2018-10-01 21:24:44	ValleyBell	(sample rate of the extracted sample)
2018-10-01 21:24:45	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Except for a few slopes I added.
2018-10-01 21:24:53	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> Which took a few hours.
2018-10-01 21:25:00	+Dick-Cord	<P​ineappleArse> I don't know why that black line appears.
2018-10-01 21:25:08	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Good job! Looks gorgeous imo.
2018-10-01 21:25:09	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> yeah, that's the thing I was gonna do by ear
2018-10-01 21:25:25	ValleyBell	I think doing it visually might be easier.
2018-10-01 21:25:44	+Dick-Cord	<L​ordXernom> Back lines = parallax issues I guess
2018-10-01 21:25:52	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> that's true actually, I'll try attempting it with mega turrican samples
2018-10-01 21:26:27	ValleyBell	Of course all the jitter might screw it up a bit.
2018-10-01 21:27:39	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> well mega turrican has little to none interruptions going on thankfully, the jittering is definitely gonna be something I'd be thinking about though
2018-10-01 21:28:17	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Kind of what I mean by a grid format instead of being able to place circles anywhere.

2018-10-01 21:30:17	ValleyBell	For GEMS, btw, the sample rates formula is: Hz = 53267 / x
2018-10-01 21:30:28	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Also means I could make a relatively easy to work with beatmap format ␤As shown in the diagram, it'd look like: ␤https://gist.github.com/aab5ad96025f9a96717c00e472967c34#file-block0-.null ␤Which could be kept in .bin files.
2018-10-01 21:30:28	ValleyBell	where x is a number from 4 to 10
2018-10-01 21:31:04	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> And uh, in place of a spin gimmick is a mash gimmick.
2018-10-01 21:33:40	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> alright thank you for the GEMS tip
2018-10-01 21:34:08	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> any idea on Vic Tokai's formula? I recall you researching their driver before
2018-10-01 21:34:24	ValleyBell	umm... I don't think I researched that one
2018-10-01 21:34:30	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> For Socket
2018-10-01 21:34:35	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> the hedgeduck hafck
2018-10-01 21:34:39	ValleyBell	Oh, right.
2018-10-01 21:34:47	ValleyBell	Sorry, I didn't have a look at the DAC side.
2018-10-01 21:34:58	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> Alright, that's fine. Thanks for the help
2018-10-01 21:35:09	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> I also designed a mascot for osu! Sonic 1 Mix. Her name's Soni-Chan I don't have a drawing on me of her, but she's cute. She basically pops everytime you get multipliers in multiples of 50s. Also on the fail screen, and basically everywhere. 😛
2018-10-01 21:35:25	ValleyBell	Feel free to compile a list of games with nice DAC samples.
2018-10-01 21:35:32	ValleyBell	I might have a look when I want to have some fun.
2018-10-01 21:36:21	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> Alrighty
2018-10-01 21:36:51	+Dick-Cord	<O​zaleto> Will let you know when list is done
2018-10-01 21:38:13	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> I'm also thinking of making osu! Sonic 1 Mix open-source so people can develop skins and beatmaps featuring their own SMPS or difficulties for existing songs. ~~Let's see how long it takes for someone to make a version of GHZ that only Cookiezi can beat~~
2018-10-01 21:40:23	+Dick-Cord	<I​so Killo> Other plans include mods (DT will be easy since there's a pre-existing speed up function for the music), SRAM for high scores and some sort of extra mode, like... Multiplayer?

2018-10-02 22:20:52	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> MIT? Yeah, sure. It's not a viral license.
2018-10-02 22:23:57	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> All MIT really cares about is making sure the license and copyright notice are included in any derivates.
2018-10-02 22:24:02	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> Also liability.
2018-10-02 22:25:09	+Dick-Cord	<C​lownacy> IANAL, but I'd say MIT is just about giving credit. Not dictating what you can and cannot do with your own code.
