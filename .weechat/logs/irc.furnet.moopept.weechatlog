2018-09-21 15:39:26	Cake	varek might know though!
2018-09-21 15:40:15	moopept	i'll pm, i'm always reluctant to do drug-chat in #ygbfurs, because i dunno what alastair is like O.o
2018-09-21 15:40:17	moopept	also with my job and all dat
2018-09-21 15:40:18	moopept	init
2018-09-21 15:40:31	Cake	that's fair enough
2018-09-21 15:40:35	Cake	I just talk about it openly :P
2018-09-21 15:40:43	Cake	my boss already knows
2018-09-21 16:39:24	moopept	varek knew less than you

2018-09-21 16:39:32	moopept	didnt know what GHB was 
2018-09-21 16:40:42	Cake	heh
2018-09-21 16:41:01	Cake	maybe erowid / tripsit / psychonaut wiki knows more
2018-09-21 16:41:41	moopept	it now seems its def the right thing, and it really is this cheap
2018-09-21 16:41:56	moopept	but i need to figure out now if >99.5% purity is enough
2018-09-21 16:41:59	moopept	what if the other 0.5% is death liquid
2018-09-21 16:58:15	Cake	guinea pig it
2018-09-21 16:58:18	Cake	...with yourself
2018-09-21 16:58:38	moopept	a post on reddit suggests that the 0.5% is only likely to be water
2018-09-21 16:59:00	Cake	yea I'd imagine so
2018-09-21 16:59:14	moopept	and i guess at a 1ml dosage, it'd be 0.5% of 1ml if it was anything dodgy
2018-09-21 16:59:53	Cake	I mean that's not a good metric
2018-09-21 17:00:01	Cake	that much fent could kill u rite
2018-09-21 17:14:22	moopept	I guess i'll try it

2018-09-25 14:24:08	moopept	but dats not my jam
2018-09-25 14:24:08	moopept	init
2018-09-25 14:24:17	Cake	oh sheet
2018-09-25 14:24:20	Cake	that's a bit serious
2018-09-25 14:24:55	moopept	shes actually remarkably restrained with it, which is weird, very unlike her
2018-09-25 14:25:00	moopept	she just fucking smashes all other drugs
2018-09-25 14:25:01	moopept	but not heroin
2018-09-25 14:25:05	moopept	she's shit scared of it
2018-09-25 14:25:56	Cake	...for now
2018-09-25 14:26:10	moopept	well indeed
2018-09-25 14:26:17	moopept	I'm unsure what type of relationship i want with her atm
2018-09-25 14:26:39	moopept	So basically we dated for years, lived together, broke up because reasons (many reasons), and didn't even talk for 3 years
2018-09-25 14:26:58	moopept	and now we're friends again, i go to see her at her GF's house, her GF is chill and all dat
2018-09-25 14:27:39	moopept	But weirdly, last week i got a message from my ex, which in summary was "so yeah like, i have feelings, how do you feel about the possibility of a relationship? i've talked to my GF about it, and shes down with me having another partner" 
2018-09-25 14:27:39	moopept	O.o
2018-09-25 14:27:59	Cake	that's... interesting
2018-09-25 14:28:04	Cake	I dunno how I'd feel about that
2018-09-25 14:28:29	moopept	I found it super weird that she had literally had a convo with her GF, in their monogamous relationship, about if it was ok if she had a relationship with me
2018-09-25 14:28:35	moopept	... without, at any point, actually ASKING ME first xD
2018-09-25 14:29:17	moopept	we talked about it and i was like "we'll see how things pan out, i dont want to base our interactions on the idea that we may or may not be working towards a relationship, lets just go on as we are, see what happens"
2018-09-25 14:29:26	moopept	>>>>>>> fucked her the next day
2018-09-25 14:29:29	moopept	¬_¬
2018-09-25 14:29:55	Cake	oh you~
2018-09-25 14:29:59	Cake	well at least you got that down
2018-09-25 14:30:09	moopept	It was so weird
2018-09-25 14:30:17	moopept	because like, it just kinda happened
2018-09-25 14:30:20	moopept	and HER GF WAS IN THE NEXT ROOm
2018-09-25 14:30:37	moopept	and i was like "right i need to actually clarify before this goes down ----- is your GF gonna be cool with this or not"
2018-09-25 14:31:13	Cake	ahaha
2018-09-25 14:31:19	Cake	doesn't matter had sex
2018-09-25 14:31:53	moopept	it was mega, probs like, i dunno, maybe the best ever x.x i guess because it also had the whole makeup sex vibes, and the weirdness of the situation
2018-09-25 14:32:06	moopept	shit lasted like 3 hours, it was just bizarre and intense
2018-09-25 14:32:10	moopept	weird ting
2018-09-25 14:32:15	moopept	i should probs get ready for work

2018-09-30 12:56:43	moopept	i can see 14b being super addictive
2018-09-30 12:56:52	moopept	because 0 hangover
2018-09-30 12:56:57	moopept	and its like pennies a dose
2018-09-30 12:58:28	Cake	maybe dont do it on school nights:P
2018-09-30 13:01:50	moopept	i had 2ml and that got me on a nice level, i think 2.5ml would have probs been the sweet spot but i didn't want to try the extra .5 while at home by myself incase i like, i dunno, died, or whatever
2018-09-30 13:02:30	Cake	d'y know what the lethal dose it
2018-09-30 13:02:32	Cake	*is
2018-09-30 13:02:36	moopept	it was kinda hard to judge, because with alcohol you kinda can benchmark if you're super overdoing it by familiar benchmarks, or nausea, or dizzyness, or whatever
2018-09-30 13:02:44	moopept	whereas this didnt have any of the dizzyness, or the nausea
2018-09-30 13:02:53	moopept	i expect much more and i'd just insta pass out
2018-09-30 13:03:16	moopept	same as GHB i guess, which is like 10g or something
2018-09-30 13:03:41	moopept	but most deaths relating to GHB/GBL, and the one documented 14b death, are because of asphyxiation as a result of passing out in a bad position or whatever
2018-09-30 13:04:05	moopept	but thats only the same risk alcohol or ket or any other downer carries
2018-09-30 13:05:27	Cake	oh shit 10g is loads
2018-09-30 13:06:39	moopept	i wanna get some food colouring to dye the 14b blue or something, if im gonna start actually having it as a neato social recreational drug, so i dont ever accidentally just drink out the bottle or whatever
2018-09-30 13:06:43	moopept	blue == dont drink me
2018-09-30 13:09:54	Cake	smurt
2018-09-30 13:10:44	moopept	next time im gonna buy GBL though, because 14b uses the alcohol pathway to metabolise, it competes with alcohol, and if i drank alcohol, then had 14b, 14b wont be metabolised until the alc has.. and i might be like "dis isnt working, i have more"
2018-09-30 13:10:48	moopept	and then it all kicks in at the same time
2018-09-30 13:10:53	moopept	and then i die or whatevs
2018-09-30 13:11:02	moopept	whereas GBL uses a different pathway to metabolise, independant of alcohol
2018-09-30 13:12:22	Cake	yeah that sounds... way smarter
2018-09-30 13:13:00	moopept	i only got the 14b due to availability but i since found a GBL source, theyre all GHB prodrugs anyway, just diff pathways C: 
2018-09-30 13:13:18	moopept	i dunno if you know much about GHB but its an endogenous chemical that the body deals with super easily, and its present in all sorts of foods
2018-09-30 13:13:22	moopept	wine has traces of GHB naturally!
2018-09-30 13:13:26	Cake	huh
2018-09-30 13:13:30	Cake	yeah no didn't know that
2018-09-30 13:13:34	Cake	I've only actually done it once

2018-10-02 11:58:51	moopept	Felt mega euphoric, i hit the sweet spot, i totally understand the appeal
2018-10-02 11:59:01	Cake	hmm
2018-10-02 11:59:05	Cake	maybe I'll get some :^)
2018-10-02 11:59:05	moopept	It felt like, low MDMA dose euphoric, with lots of alcohol, and a bit dis'y (only slightly)
2018-10-02 11:59:11	Cake	oh huh
2018-10-02 11:59:14	Cake	yeah that sounds pretty nice
2018-10-02 11:59:17	moopept	I was sat happily swaying to music just thinking "i'm FUCKED"
2018-10-02 11:59:27	Cake	haha
2018-10-02 11:59:30	moopept	by low dose i mean like, i dunno, 50-60mg MDMA i guess
2018-10-02 11:59:53	moopept	except this was 2.5ml of BDO, at the cost of like 40 pence
2018-10-02 11:59:53	moopept	.
2018-10-02 12:05:50	Cake	I dunno what doses of MDMA are
2018-10-02 12:05:52	Cake	I alway eyeball it
2018-10-02 12:06:25	moopept	think of 50mg as "half a pill" i guess
2018-10-02 12:09:33	Cake	oh fair enough
2018-10-02 12:13:42	Cake	yee that sounds chill :3
