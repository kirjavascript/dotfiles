2018-09-18 21:19:52	+trinary	Set irc.look.server_buffer = independent and install autosort.py
2018-09-18 21:19:53	+ym	weechat is really customizable
2018-09-18 21:20:33	+ym	use /set weechat.look.* to all the options you can change 
2018-09-18 21:20:42	+ym	to see all*
2018-09-18 21:21:24	+trinary	Kirjava - What's up with those random characters all over the place?
2018-09-18 21:22:05	+Kirjava	yeah I like it I made a uᴉƃnld that does random stuff
2018-09-18 21:22:22	+Kirjava	trinary: no idea
2018-09-18 21:23:00	+Kirjava	need to fix
2018-09-18 21:23:55	+Kirjava	yeah trying to figure out how to sort
2018-09-18 21:23:59	+Kirjava	it looked complicated
2018-09-18 21:24:41	+dysfigured	Kirjava: yeah the defaults are lame. here's mine tho https://u.teknik.io/owLKy.png
2018-09-18 21:24:53	+Kirjava	dat sum powerline
2018-09-18 21:25:08	+Kirjava	I looked at themes but there are like 4
2018-09-18 21:25:15	+Kirjava	so i guess that is not how to style it
2018-09-18 21:25:16	+dysfigured	make your own
2018-09-18 21:25:19	+Kirjava	yea
2018-09-18 21:25:30	+Kirjava	wanna fix this dumb text first
2018-09-18 21:25:43	+dysfigured	what dumb text
2018-09-18 21:25:53	+Kirjava	look at the image I posted
2018-09-18 21:25:55	+Kirjava	the characters
2018-09-18 21:25:59	+Kirjava	and line
2018-09-18 21:26:01	+dysfigured	oh. redraw, ^L
2018-09-18 21:26:48	+Kirjava	fixes it but it happens again when IU go on a channel with those characters
2018-09-18 21:26:57	+Kirjava	which is annoying when they're in the topic
2018-09-18 21:26:57	+dysfigured	my config is on github and you can feed it into a running github instance without restarting
2018-09-18 21:27:12	+Kirjava	github instance?
2018-09-18 21:27:19	+dysfigured	err, weechat instance
2018-09-18 21:27:33	+dysfigured	weechat uses a fifo you can feed commands into
2018-09-18 21:27:47	+Kirjava	cool
2018-09-18 21:27:59	+dysfigured	did you install buffers.pl?
2018-09-18 21:27:59	+Kirjava	channels being on the wrong numbers is really throwing me off
2018-09-18 21:28:14	+Kirjava	no I have the plugin I made and that's it
2018-09-18 21:28:16	+Kirjava	is it like vim
2018-09-18 21:28:19	+Kirjava	do I need 300 plugins
2018-09-18 21:28:49	+dysfigured	eh nah
2018-09-18 21:28:50	+Kirjava	I like that you get a list to install
2018-09-18 21:29:08	+dysfigured	i thought the default channel list was sorted into trees automatically
2018-09-18 21:30:01	+Kirjava	in irssi I had the channels in a specific order, but not grouped by server
2018-09-18 21:30:06	+Kirjava	how do I do that
2018-09-18 21:30:19	+dysfigured	gross

2018-09-19 00:30:05	+brooks	just started thinking about it
2018-09-19 00:30:18	+naught0	tech book like how
2018-09-19 00:30:22	+naught0	like a codin book
2018-09-19 00:31:39	+brooks	or whatever else
2018-09-19 00:32:06	+brooks	systems administration, programming, particular tools
2018-09-19 00:33:28	+LambdaComplex	brooks: have you read the awk programming language?
2018-09-19 00:33:49	+brooks	yep
2018-09-19 00:33:54	+brooks	why do you ask
2018-09-19 00:34:04	+LambdaComplex	because it's a good book!
2018-09-19 00:34:09	+brooks	yes it is
2018-09-19 00:34:18	 *	LambdaComplex thinks harder
2018-09-19 00:34:28	+brooks	I'm due for a reread
2018-09-19 00:34:30	+LambdaComplex	why don't you write a book
2018-09-19 00:34:37	+brooks	I was younger and dumber
2018-09-19 00:34:50	+Arathnim	The Art of Unix Programming?

2018-09-19 00:35:57	+brooks	that one I've read
2018-09-19 00:36:04	+brooks	I should probably write a book about how stupid ESR is, though
2018-09-19 00:36:11	+LambdaComplex	top kek
2018-09-19 00:36:13	+brooks	haven't read the art of unix programming
2018-09-19 00:36:29	+Arathnim	It's a useful perspective, especially when developing a critique of unix-style operating systems.
2018-09-19 00:36:35	+LambdaComplex	remember, brooks: you can tell how smart someone is just by looking at them
2018-09-19 00:36:40	+LambdaComplex	well, maybe you can't. but ESR can!
2018-09-19 00:37:09	+Arathnim	Unix set back OS development 40 years, C set back language development by 20, etc.

2018-09-19 00:41:02	+dysfigured	>rust >functional  agreed. rust is imperative af
2018-09-19 00:41:37	+brooks	rust is heavily inspired by fp, yeah, but it does a lot to make it closer to fp because it knows it isn't
2018-09-19 00:41:40	+LambdaComplex	sorry i can't hear you over the Fn type
2018-09-19 00:41:53	+Arathnim	Things like syntax and language change, but the idea is to focus on deeper models.
2018-09-19 00:41:57	+LambdaComplex	whateverrrrrrrrrrr
2018-09-19 00:41:58	+dysfigured	inb4 >muh iterators  yeah that doesn't make it a functional language, any more than JS is functional just because it has map/reduce/filter
2018-09-19 00:42:03	+LambdaComplex	brooks: how about Introducing Elixir
2018-09-19 00:42:05	+RMS	i really wish logitech would add linux support to their key boards
2018-09-19 00:42:14	+brooks	hmu
2018-09-19 00:42:29	+brooks	RMS: I use logitech keyboards?
2018-09-19 00:42:34	+Arathnim	e.g. destructuring, pattern matching, types
2018-09-19 00:43:13	+dysfigured	types make a functional language "good" but you can be a functional language with dynamic types. elixir for example
2018-09-19 00:43:26	+RMS	brooks: well i have g413 carbon

2018-09-19 01:55:42	+brooks	that's a false dichotomy
2018-09-19 01:55:44	+brooks	like
2018-09-19 01:56:10	+brooks	it presumes that society is presently tolerable for the people the change is for
2018-09-19 01:56:32	+brooks	imagine e.g. saying that black people should tolerate segregation
2018-09-19 01:56:40	+brooks	and wait for slow societal change
2018-09-19 01:56:43	+brooks	it's crazy

2018-09-19 01:59:12	+brooks	a lot do, though

2018-09-19 06:18:27	+Uncled1023	hi
2018-09-19 06:19:49	+dysfigured	i like coconut more than python, once i get more comfy with python proper im gonna start doing everythin in coconut
2018-09-19 06:20:35	+dysfigured	and probably pick up a bit of pyth for funsies
2018-09-19 06:20:53	+Nux	you should own windows with it
2018-09-19 06:20:54	+Nux	its fun
2018-09-19 06:20:58	+dysfigured	actual python'ers gon hate me
2018-09-19 06:22:15	+sj1k	Daym there is a lot going on in your ps1 Nux xD
2018-09-19 06:22:22	+Nux	happens
2018-09-19 06:22:51	+dysfigured	my prompt is best prompt
2018-09-19 06:25:06	+dysfigured	has lots of git info when applicable, shows user@host only when $SSH_CONNECTION is set, shows python venv when applicable
2018-09-19 06:25:26	+Nux	obvious didnt look at my ps1 code
2018-09-19 06:26:07	+dysfigured	stays 'minimal' but shows more info when it makes sense. and fits in a single line
2018-09-19 06:26:43	+dysfigured	two line prompts are terribad
2018-09-19 06:28:06	+brooks	why I like zsh
2018-09-19 06:28:14	+brooks	get the advantages of a 2 line prompt with one line
2018-09-19 06:28:17	+brooks	left/right
2018-09-19 06:29:35	+dysfigured	i only use RPROMPT for vi indicator tbh
2018-09-19 06:30:13	+brooks	my current dir is on the right
2018-09-19 06:30:18	+brooks	it gets hidden if I write something long
2018-09-19 06:30:57	+dysfigured	right, i dont like losing info like that
2018-09-19 06:31:49	+brooks	it's visible on the line before
2018-09-19 06:32:00	+brooks	most of the tim
2018-09-19 06:32:02	+brooks	time
2018-09-19 06:33:19	+sj1k	Why not have it on the left?
2018-09-19 06:34:43	+dysfigured	fwiw heres my two line bash prompt which had most/all the features i wanted https://github.com/DanielFGray/dotfiles/blob/master/bashrc
2018-09-19 06:36:14	+sj1k	What does it end up like?
2018-09-19 06:36:30	+sj1k	obviously it changes a lot but, a couple examples?
2018-09-19 06:38:51	+Nux	prolly gonna switch to vim
2018-09-19 06:38:51	+dysfigured	https://u.teknik.io/Azu3t.png
2018-09-19 06:39:09	+dysfigured	best i can do from phone
2018-09-19 06:39:54	+sj1k	o right you're on phone
2018-09-19 06:39:55	+dysfigured	note that [user@host] only shows in ssh
2018-09-19 06:40:01	+sj1k	still looks pretty gud
2018-09-19 06:42:25	+dysfigured	took a while to get git info like i wanted. red branch means uncommitted changes, + means theres stuff staged, has a few other markers for merge conflicts and mid-rebase
2018-09-19 06:42:58	+dysfigured	i also really like the return values in the prompt if non-zero
2018-09-19 06:43:34	+brooks	I do red prompt for non-zero return
2018-09-19 06:43:40	+brooks	I should add the #
2018-09-19 06:44:05	+dysfigured	i forked agnoster just to add that
2018-09-19 06:44:22	+dysfigured	(agnoster is my zsh prompt)
2018-09-19 06:45:11	+brooks	I forked mine 2
2018-09-19 06:45:23	+brooks	but it's not public bc I still don't have a gitlab I'll use
2018-09-19 06:45:30	+brooks	I don't rec isolation like this
2018-09-19 06:46:01	+dysfigured	id send PRs to your dots if i could

2018-09-19 12:00:12	+cosarara	winny: what's the best/most interesting/most useful program written in racket?
2018-09-19 12:00:20	+Kirjava	dr racket
2018-09-19 12:00:27	+Kirjava	oh wait that's probably not even written in racket
2018-09-19 12:00:32	+winny	cosarara: thats v subjective
2018-09-19 12:00:37	+winny	Kirjava: drracket is written in racket
2018-09-19 12:00:47	+Kirjava	there's your answer then
2018-09-19 12:01:14	+cosarara	I don't know much about dr racket but it doesn't sound very interesting to me
2018-09-19 12:01:21	+cosarara	is it much better than say, emacs?
2018-09-19 12:01:36	+winny	no
2018-09-19 12:01:40	+winny	well depends
2018-09-19 12:01:54	+trinary	http://cufp.org/2011/functional-mzscheme-dsls-game-development.html
2018-09-19 12:01:56	+winny	i use mostly emacs but drracket is objectively better tooled than racket-mode
2018-09-19 12:03:00	+cosarara	something I use as a measure of language popularity is, are there any packages in the debian repo written in it?
2018-09-19 12:03:18	+winny	racket
2018-09-19 12:03:20	+winny	lololol
2018-09-19 12:04:51	+trinary	cosarara - That's a bad metric if you care about popularity
2018-09-19 12:05:09	+cosarara	how so?
2018-09-19 12:05:49	+trinary	It just covers a few fairly narrow categories of software one could a programming language for
2018-09-19 12:05:58	+trinary	*could use a
2018-09-19 12:06:23	+cosarara	ah well but racket is a general purpose language comparable to, say, python, isn't it?
2018-09-19 12:06:33	+cosarara	there are many packages using python in debian
2018-09-19 12:06:39	+trinary	Yes
2018-09-19 12:06:41	+cosarara	or perl, or ruby
2018-09-19 12:07:13	+trinary	I'm not saying Racket is popular, just that I think your chosen indicator is bad
2018-09-19 12:07:42	+cosarara	well it's a threshold kind of thing
2018-09-19 12:08:04	+trinary	Also consider how long it took Rust build support to enter Debian
2018-09-19 12:08:31	+cosarara	well I said debian just as I could have said arch
2018-09-19 12:08:45	+cosarara	to be honest I'm not very familiar with debian's packaging
2018-09-19 12:09:12	+cosarara	there's quite a lot of rust packages in the arch repo
2018-09-19 12:09:29	+cosarara	go too
2018-09-19 12:09:40	+Kirjava	I really am going to have to drop weechat and got back to irssi this is redic http://i.imgur.com/QmKwZQK.png
2018-09-19 12:09:44	+Kirjava	does anyone else get this shit
2018-09-19 12:09:56	+trinary	Yes, but not with weechat
2018-09-19 12:10:23	+cosarara	never seen that no
2018-09-19 12:10:25	+Kirjava	it's not a terminal thing either
2018-09-19 12:10:31	+trinary	How do you tell?
2018-09-19 12:10:36	+Kirjava	tried a few terminals

2018-09-19 12:11:48	+Kirjava	sorted
2018-09-19 12:12:02	+trinary	I can alternatively give you my config, so that we can determine if it's your config
2018-09-19 12:13:11	+Kirjava	I can try it with a nubile config
2018-09-19 12:13:30	+cosarara	does nubile mean clean/default?
2018-09-19 12:13:56	+Kirjava	uh.. kinda
2018-09-19 12:13:59	+trinary	"marriageable"
2018-09-19 12:14:09	+trinary	That's a weird thing to say about a config
2018-09-19 12:14:46	+Kirjava	ok it doesn't seem to break with a fresh config
2018-09-19 12:15:01	+trinary	Well, there you go
2018-09-19 12:15:27	+trinary	(Have fun with that binary search)
2018-09-19 12:15:44	+Kirjava	yeah :/
2018-09-19 12:15:57	+Kirjava	problem is I don't wanna have to keep restarting ;-;
2018-09-19 12:16:06	+Kirjava	I know you don't have to but I probably have to be careful
2018-09-19 12:17:36	+Kirjava	I guess I used nubile more akin to 'virgin'
2018-09-19 12:18:16	+cosarara	anyway trinary on the topic of popularity, what's a better metric to know if people are building useful things with a language or not?
2018-09-19 12:18:45	+trinary	cosarara - I guess my point was that not all useful things built in a language should be put into the repos of a linux distribution
2018-09-19 12:20:21	+cosarara	my theory is that if enough useful things are built in a language, some of them will end up there
2018-09-19 12:20:35	+winny	weechat? more like wewchat
2018-09-19 12:20:43	+cosarara	but under a certain size that makes projects invisible

2018-09-19 12:21:22	+trinary	cosarara - Oh, yes, some. If there's demand. But the amount of package is not a good indicator of overall popularity, it will be missing e.g. games, web applications, research libraries
2018-09-19 12:22:16	+trinary	You can combine it with e.g. https://github.com/topics/racket , which displays another limited (but different) set of Racket software

2018-09-19 12:32:12	+cosarara	well https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2 is a real world thing, good!
2018-09-19 12:32:24	+cosarara	and https://github.com/mwunsch/overscan is interesting
2018-09-19 12:36:43	+trinary	herbie too
2018-09-19 12:38:40	+trinary	But if you're looking for a vibrant ecosystem, job opportunities, and ways to contribute to popular FOSS, Racket is not a good choice
2018-09-19 12:39:38	+cosarara	my face after reading `Herbie synthesizes floating-point programs from real-number programs, automatically handling simple numerical instabilities` was quite the sight
2018-09-19 12:40:29	+cosarara	they have a more understandable explanation on theird website
2018-09-19 12:40:36	+cosarara	their
2018-09-19 13:32:02	+winny	cosarara: btw re arch vs debian packaging, arch isn't really a fair comparison to a rock solid linux distro that has pretty high quality control and half decent tooling around packaging software
2018-09-19 13:33:19	+winny	one the biggest issues is the community's idea that you can build arch packages outside of a clean chroot, if they'd enforce that or otherwise strongly discourage using aur helpers that don't do that, arch would be a lot better for packaging
2018-09-19 13:33:50	+winny	like it's easy to build anything without leakage, let alone using cargo from rustup

2018-09-19 14:55:00	+LambdaComplex	hi bdelloid!
2018-09-19 14:55:23	+Kirjava	bdelloid: jackie chan, allegedly
2018-09-19 14:55:25	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, hey
2018-09-19 14:55:33	+bdelloid	Kirjava, wat
2018-09-19 14:55:44	+Kirjava	sorry I mean CHICKEN BUTT
2018-09-19 14:59:03	+cosarara	winny: it's a benchmark of how often the language is used in real world applications, not of how easy it is to package, so the distro with the more accessible packaging is probably the best reference
2018-09-19 15:03:05	+cosarara	so for example, if I look at the page for the rust arch package I see 27 packages depend on it (either building or runtime, I don't care). ghc, 680. lua, 83. sbcl, only maxima. python, 1303. racket, 0
2018-09-19 15:06:20	+Kirjava	poor racket
2018-09-19 15:06:23	+Kirjava	WHAT A RACKET
2018-09-19 15:09:06	+cosarara	well sbcl also depends on itself to build, which racket doesn't
2018-09-19 15:09:24	+trinary	cosarara - See, now that's unfair. They package every Haskell library they could find
2018-09-19 15:09:43	+Kirjava	yeah 680 haskell wtf
2018-09-19 15:09:53	+cosarara	well yes trinary it is unfair
2018-09-19 15:10:07	+cosarara	it has to be taken with a lot of salt
2018-09-19 15:10:42	+trinary	nixpkgs has 48k packages, according to repology, because they count the package haskell libraries
2018-09-19 15:12:12	+cosarara	but there *are* more things than libraries built with ghc
2018-09-19 15:12:22	+trinary	Sure
2018-09-19 15:12:38	+cosarara	cgrep,  darcs, git-annex, pandoc, happy, xmonad
2018-09-19 15:12:40	+trinary	There are also more things than libraries built with racket
2018-09-19 15:13:53	+winny	cosarara: keep in mind the way rust is packaged means u only get actual programs ppl use, whereas haskell they tend to package every single tiny dep seperately
2018-09-19 15:14:23	+cosarara	guys it's not a "let's see which count is bigger"
2018-09-19 15:14:29	+winny	i know
2018-09-19 15:14:31	+cosarara	it's a "let's see if it's over 2"
2018-09-19 15:14:35	+winny	:3
2018-09-19 15:14:45	+cosarara	if there is a single application or tool in the repo it's a pass
2018-09-19 15:14:50	+cosarara	if there isn't, it's a fail
2018-09-19 15:15:04	+cosarara	haskell passes, sbcl barely, racket doesn't
2018-09-19 15:15:31	+winny	it's true i suppose
2018-09-19 15:19:32	+winny	of course some aur deps but wew https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/racket-git

2018-09-19 17:02:54	+Kirjava	is shitposting a good or bad thing
2018-09-19 17:03:06	+brooks	yes
2018-09-19 17:03:28	+Kirjava	I swear my mind was like "someone is just going to say both why did you ask"
2018-09-19 17:03:49	+brooks	shitposting is fine when it's not detracting from conversation that's actually unironic
2018-09-19 17:03:55	+brooks	but also we're so irony poisoned
2018-09-19 17:04:25	+Kirjava	we talking situational irony or... ?
2018-09-19 17:05:09	+bdelloid	I am entirely made of irony
2018-09-19 17:05:18	+brooks	uhhh
2018-09-19 17:05:24	+brooks	to give you an overly serious answer
2018-09-19 17:05:41	+Kirjava	a serious answer, how ironic
2018-09-19 17:05:54	+brooks	irony poisoning refers to the prevalence of ironic humor made into something resembling faux-ironic humor
2018-09-19 17:06:26	+brooks	i.e. the joke ceases to be a joke and becomes real but with the undertone of the irony it started out with
2018-09-19 17:06:44	+brooks	a kind of nihilistic cynicism
2018-09-19 17:06:58	+brooks	but nihilistic in the real sense, not of something chosen but of something that affects you
2018-09-19 17:07:22	+brooks	and yes
2018-09-19 17:07:24	+brooks	@ ironic
2018-09-19 17:07:59	+brooks	tl;dr irony poisoning is when you're so used to irony that it becomes a primary mode of communication even when the actual irony conveyed ceases to exist
2018-09-19 17:08:03	+brooks	take for example
2018-09-19 17:08:53	+brooks	people who regularly make the "joke" that they're resisting suicide for one more video from <youtube channel they watch regularly>
2018-09-19 17:09:19	+brooks	so shitposting is now a dominant form of expression even when the underlying irony is gone
2018-09-19 17:09:51	+brooks	it's hard to say that's bad, since people can't just be serious all the time due to the irony poisoning
2018-09-19 17:10:02	+brooks	but it's also obviously not a great state of affairs
2018-09-19 17:10:42	+Kirjava	"how many layers of abstraction are you on now, my dude?"

2018-09-19 17:23:30	+Kirjava	like why the fuck do they even sell it there
2018-09-19 17:23:34	+Kirjava	dysfigured: no shit's all fucked
2018-09-19 17:23:51	+Kirjava	I tried changing some random settings but that didn't help
2018-09-19 17:24:18	+Kirjava	I think next I'll try targetting related settings instead

2018-09-19 17:26:39	+brooks	wtf
2018-09-19 17:26:47	+dysfigured	it's what the fifo is for really
2018-09-19 17:26:49	+brooks	I wondered what the fifo was for
2018-09-19 17:26:53	+brooks	I disabled it bc security

2018-09-19 17:27:31	+dysfigured	fuck that do it now
2018-09-19 17:27:33	+Kirjava	so can't really fuck around much
2018-09-19 17:27:34	+Kirjava	NO
2018-09-19 17:27:39	+Kirjava	I HAVE A BOOKING
2018-09-19 17:27:48	+brooks	why do you use > instead of >>?
2018-09-19 17:27:56	+Kirjava	dysfigured: I will boop you again
2018-09-19 17:27:57	+brooks	"you" being the general you
2018-09-19 17:27:58	+dysfigured	because it's a fifo and it doesn't matter
2018-09-19 17:28:04	+brooks	the example does too
2018-09-19 17:28:11	+dysfigured	there's no append or overwrite when it comes to fifo
2018-09-19 17:28:12	+brooks	I was wondering if it matters yeah
2018-09-19 17:28:18	+brooks	like if I do >> will it work 
2018-09-19 17:28:27	+dysfigured	yeah p sure
2018-09-19 17:28:30	+brooks	also does zsh complain that the fifo exists
2018-09-19 17:28:36	+dysfigured	test it with some bunk input
2018-09-19 17:28:36	+brooks	and ask you to use >!
2018-09-19 17:29:03	+dysfigured	i don't think i've ever had that in my life
2018-09-19 17:29:42	+Kirjava	OK BYE SEE SOON

2018-09-19 17:51:21	+dysfigured	no.
2018-09-19 17:51:37	+brooks	fish does this from manual pages
2018-09-19 17:51:39	+dysfigured	i'll keep my posix compat and history expansions tyvm
2018-09-19 17:51:41	+brooks	and it's a feature
2018-09-19 17:51:48	+dysfigured	zsh can do everything fish can do
2018-09-19 17:51:56	+brooks	but can it be fast
2018-09-19 17:52:02	+brooks	history expansions are harmful
2018-09-19 17:52:09	+brooks	and fzf > expansions anyway
2018-09-19 17:52:21	+brooks	but otherwise yeah it's a shame
2018-09-19 17:52:25	+brooks	I liked the idea behind fish a lot
2018-09-19 17:53:30	+dysfigured	fzf can't !$ or !* or !#:n
2018-09-19 17:54:15	+brooks	it probably could
2018-09-19 17:55:21	+dysfigured	i can't see any possible way it could, especially without making it more combersome when it's already simple af
2018-09-19 17:57:53	+brooks	it'd just evaluate the history expansions and show you what they resolve to so that you can interactively change them
2018-09-19 17:58:01	+brooks	t. bret victor
2018-09-19 17:58:09	+dysfigured	fzf can't evaluate anything tho
2018-09-19 17:58:15	+brooks	not yet
2018-09-19 17:58:17	+dysfigured	it's just a generic filter like dmenu
2018-09-19 17:58:23	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-19 17:58:34	+brooks	but in principle this is something I'd say it's suited to
2018-09-19 17:58:58	+dysfigured	idk i don't see the point. just type a few characters and tab-complete them
2018-09-19 17:59:18	+brooks	instant visual feedback without making a deliberate effort to get it
2018-09-19 17:59:18	+dysfigured	(zsh lets you tab-complete history expansions, well, all expansions really)

2018-09-19 18:01:51	+dysfigured	oh
2018-09-19 18:02:07	+trinary	At least, I didn't find a good solution when I switched from fish to zsh
2018-09-19 18:02:16	+brooks	same
2018-09-19 18:02:35	+brooks	fish is one of those things I think everyone would benefit from using to get an idea of how a shell could be, even if you can't ultimately use it

2018-09-19 18:04:13	+trinary	I did initially, reading from the bottom up, but "help text" can have a different content than the manpage

2018-09-19 18:57:55	+dysfigured	x for x basically means leave x as-is

2018-09-19 18:58:15	+Nux	oh ok
2018-09-19 18:58:37	+dysfigured	only shadowing is perhapd using the the same var name to assign the result
2018-09-19 18:58:41	+dysfigured	x = x for x..
2018-09-19 18:59:05	+dysfigured	but the rhs of the assignment is evaulated first, those x's are out of scope by the time the value is binded

2018-09-19 19:24:36	+brooks	write a longer loop and print the outputs and see where the discrepancy is
2018-09-19 19:25:09	+brooks	my guess would be whitespace too
2018-09-19 19:25:18	+dysfigured	id, *title = out[0].split(' ') 
2018-09-19 19:25:50	+dysfigured	in js the equivalent (slightly more explicit) would be like..

2018-09-19 19:27:12	+dysfigured	id would be 7, title would be ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
2018-09-19 19:27:29	+brooks	do the types match?

2018-09-19 19:28:42	+dysfigured	i think brooks just nailed it, the id in bms is a number, but the id extractted fromt the string would be a string also
2018-09-19 19:30:02	+Nux	yes yes it would
2018-09-19 19:30:21	+dysfigured	fug. next(x for x in bms if x["id"] == int(id))  still doesn't match anything
2018-09-19 19:30:21	+Nux	it was hard going through this with out having an actual db to get shit from

Python 3 has a built-in function next() which retrieves the next item from the iterator by calling its __next__() method.

2018-09-19 19:55:54	+Nux	thats my server btw
2018-09-19 19:56:01	+Nux	hosting that
2018-09-19 19:56:32	+Nux	 /mage.txt has a little bit more infrastructure on magecart group
2018-09-19 19:56:41	+dysfigured	oh. my problem is that the generator is already at the end of the list when it tries to find that single value
2018-09-19 19:59:20	+Nux	welp
2018-09-19 19:59:32	+Nux	did you read that green text i posted
2018-09-19 19:59:50	+dysfigured	yes
2018-09-19 20:03:54	+naught0	is it something that can be expressesd as a list? if so why not list() it
2018-09-19 20:04:09	+naught0	oh wait it's empty (?)
2018-09-19 20:06:45	+dysfigured	why the fuck i can't .seek(0) on generators wtf python
2018-09-19 20:07:05	+brooks	python is a bad language
2018-09-19 20:07:21	+dysfigured	it's certainly not a great one
2018-09-19 20:09:15	+Nux	hey now
2018-09-19 20:09:20	+Nux	its python3
2018-09-19 20:09:23	+Nux	not python
2018-09-19 20:09:30	+dysfigured	...it's still python
2018-09-19 20:09:35	+Nux	just rewrite it all in 2.7
2018-09-19 20:09:38	+dysfigured	regardless of what number you put it in
2018-09-19 20:09:42	+dysfigured	*put on the end
2018-09-19 20:09:42	+brooks	that's debatable
2018-09-19 20:10:16	+Nux	it lets me own windows boxes
2018-09-19 20:10:19	+Nux	so i like it
2018-09-19 20:10:29	+dysfigured	you could do that in any language
2018-09-19 20:10:38	+dysfigured	literally, any language
2018-09-19 20:10:48	+Nux	yes you can do it in a lot
2018-09-19 20:10:48	+brooks	there's a massive wealth of sec tools in python
2018-09-19 20:10:50	+brooks	so not really
2018-09-19 20:11:09	+brooks	I mean it's true literally, but it's true in a different sense of python(2)
2018-09-19 20:11:14	+Nux	delphi is a popular choice rn
2018-09-19 20:11:31	+dysfigured	well, yeah, i mean, the main appeal of python really is the libraries people have made for it. definitely not the language itself
2018-09-19 20:11:37	+Nux	also python can bypass AV with 0 obfuscation
2018-09-19 20:11:52	+Nux	does that mean you shouldnt obfu
2018-09-19 20:11:54	+Nux	no not all
2018-09-19 20:11:59	+Nux	just stating something
2018-09-19 20:12:23	+dysfigured	much like how the appeal of js is making things that run in a browser or in the node runtime, js as a language isn't that appealing
2018-09-19 20:12:45	+Nux	js is shit and the cause for too much ownage
2018-09-19 20:12:50	+dysfigured	reminder not to learn how languages, learn how to program
2018-09-19 20:12:53	+brooks	qI actually like js a lot as a language
2018-09-19 20:13:03	+dysfigured	let me try that again
2018-09-19 20:13:09	+dysfigured	reminder not to learn languages, learn how to program
2018-09-19 20:13:16	+Nux	brooks: if you know sec shit and know what youre doing its fine
2018-09-19 20:13:33	+Nux	the issues is most of the ppl using it for major shit dont understand sec properly
2018-09-19 20:13:42	+dysfigured	nobody understands security
2018-09-19 20:13:45	+Nux	esp jquery/boostrap devs
2018-09-19 20:13:54	+dysfigured	except like, 100 or so people in the world
2018-09-19 20:14:19	+Nux	that was my point
2018-09-19 20:14:26	+dysfigured	i don't need or want to learn how the inner mechanisms of a lock work to have a lock on my front door
2018-09-19 20:14:44	+Nux	this isnt on the users tho
2018-09-19 20:14:48	+Nux	ofc they dont need to know
2018-09-19 20:15:03	+Nux	but the makers of lock and developers of code, SHOULD
2018-09-19 20:15:05	+dysfigured	users vs devs is a very thin line
2018-09-19 20:15:05	+Nux	and implement it
2018-09-19 20:15:19	+Nux	yes i agree
2018-09-19 20:15:25	+dysfigured	i'm not a react developer, i'm a react user
2018-09-19 20:15:27	+Nux	that shuldnt be a thing tho
2018-09-19 20:15:29	+dysfigured	i develop with react
2018-09-19 20:15:41	+Nux	you also arent developing major shit either
2018-09-19 20:15:44	+dysfigured	i'm not a lock maker, i'm a lock user, i make doors with locks
2018-09-19 20:16:05	+Nux	if youre deving something thats going on MILLIONS of major websites
2018-09-19 20:16:15	+Nux	you should know more than basic sec shit in programming
2018-09-19 20:16:48	+Nux	now when it hits users and they dont config it correctly
2018-09-19 20:16:52	+Nux	thats still on the devs
2018-09-19 20:16:57	+Nux	for not providing full docu
2018-09-19 20:17:05	+dysfigured	more often than not, it's not the fault of an individual dev for poor security, it's the fault of the suits who won't budget time/money for security
2018-09-19 20:17:14	+Nux	that is also v true
2018-09-19 20:18:26	+dysfigured	ideally you should contract out to people who's specialty is security, not force your frontend dev who's been pushed into fullstack to also deal with all the security
2018-09-19 20:18:31	+dysfigured	but that costs money
2018-09-19 20:18:52	+dysfigured	and a website is just a fancy billboard who actually cares how secure their billboard is
2018-09-19 20:19:10	+Nux	i saw a scrot of a signup form (not sure the site) but it said "dont use your banking login, we didnt spend a lot on secuirty for this app"
2018-09-19 20:19:17	+Nux	i actually respect the honesty
2018-09-19 20:19:18	+Nux	in that
2018-09-19 20:19:27	+dysfigured	i saw that on reddit the other day
2018-09-19 20:19:31	+Nux	lol ya

2018-09-19 20:22:37	+Nux	i got it for 79 USD
2018-09-19 20:23:35	+Nux	its also pretty secure
2018-09-19 20:24:04	+Nux	like if i install a terminal app and try to cd or ls rootfs
2018-09-19 20:24:09	+Nux	it perm denies it
2018-09-19 20:24:16	+Nux	but my LG i can get into that
2018-09-19 20:25:06	+dysfigured	vim trick of the day: stop using tilde to toggle case, use g~ gu gU
2018-09-19 20:25:06	+Nux	host-rootfs
2018-09-19 20:25:09	+Nux	my bad
2018-09-19 20:25:34	+dysfigured	g~<motion> swaps case, gu<motion> makes all lowercase, gU should be obvious at this point
2018-09-19 20:26:27	+brooks	I have a q
2018-09-19 20:26:44	+brooks	I scroll on firefox then hit ctrl+tab to switch tabs right
2018-09-19 20:26:50	+Nux	yes
2018-09-19 20:26:53	+brooks	but the scrolling is still in effect

2018-09-19 20:27:15	+dysfigured	scrolling is still in effect?
2018-09-19 20:27:33	+brooks	I've stopped scrolling
2018-09-19 20:27:37	+brooks	but it has acceleration
2018-09-19 20:27:43	+brooks	it continues to scroll after I've stopped
2018-09-19 20:27:46	+kori	isnt there a setting to disable ctrl-zoom
2018-09-19 20:27:53	+Nux	i think so
2018-09-19 20:29:19	+brooks	I mean
2018-09-19 20:29:21	+brooks	I use ctrl zoom
2018-09-19 20:29:25	+brooks	so I'd rather not just disable it

2018-09-19 21:36:14	+dysfigured	freenode.#zsh: sounds like yet another way for people to avoid writing proper [completion] functions
2018-09-19 21:36:27	+trinary	Exactly
2018-09-19 21:36:34	+trinary	Why would anyone want to write a completion function
2018-09-19 21:36:51	+dysfigured	idk man i got better shit to do
2018-09-19 21:37:09	+dysfigured	since man pages rarely contain the information needed to produce quality completion functions (that follow the usual conventions, offer useful possibilities for optargs, &c.), that is preferable in my opinion

2018-09-19 23:42:39	+sj1k	Just seen it recommended a few times
2018-09-19 23:42:47	+sj1k	and it looks better than argparse
2018-09-19 23:44:10	+dysfigured	http://ix.io/1n4F
2018-09-19 23:44:15	+dysfigured	where i'm at so far
2018-09-19 23:45:55	+dysfigured	both the list_ functions are fucked because the generators get exhausted and python doesn't offer a way to rewind things
2018-09-19 23:49:03	+sj1k	What you should do is make those list_ functions accept a base iterator, which would be the bookmarks, then they just iterate over those and then yield commands to run.
2018-09-19 23:49:58	+dysfigured	welll.. it's not something you can do in a single iteration
2018-09-19 23:50:48	+sj1k	Why not?
2018-09-19 23:52:43	+dysfigured	so it's a bookmark thing right, bookmarks are a big table, the table is 'iterable' and each row is a key:value pair
2018-09-19 23:53:39	+sj1k	yeah.
2018-09-19 23:54:12	+dysfigured	a few columns, like id and title get fed into some interface, fzf or dmenu, and the user selects one, which returns the id and title, then you have to use that id to figure out what the url is
2018-09-19 23:54:27	+sj1k	ah right
2018-09-19 23:54:31	+sj1k	I was missing that middle step
2018-09-19 23:55:17	+dysfigured	so you need one pass to convert a each row into a pretty string for the user, and then you need a partial pass to lookup the url from the id
2018-09-19 23:56:22	+sj1k	Then yeah you should probs just use a regular list
2018-09-19 23:57:20	+dysfigured	querying the database returns a weird iterable table thing, which i convert into a generator that yields dictionaries
2018-09-19 23:59:04	+sj1k	anyway, from what I understand of click you don't need to manage the if logic in your main()  you just setup decorators for the commands you want (above their respective function)
2018-09-20 00:00:04	+dysfigured	i tend to just write some bullshit pseudo code to express features in my head

2018-09-20 00:10:54	+sj1k	Rust seems to be the best fit
2018-09-20 00:11:02	+LambdaComplex	also maybe rustbox?
2018-09-20 00:11:12	+sj1k	Okay so there are a few options, at least.
2018-09-20 00:11:23	+sj1k	'ncurses-level control' is fine tbh
2018-09-20 00:11:33	+LambdaComplex	also maybe pancurses

2018-09-20 00:12:38	+LambdaComplex	the "Let's Create a GUI" section of the GUI library tutorial still does not exist

2018-09-20 00:15:20	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-20 00:15:22	+brooks	it is a meme though
2018-09-20 00:15:23	+dysfigured	best type system that exists. mature and stable ecosystem

2018-09-20 00:15:39	+brooks	arguably purescript has the better type system

2018-09-20 00:17:51	+brooks	the thing about haskell is that it's super academic and no one can tell without drinking the koolaid whether it's actually as powerful as the koolaid drinkers say

2018-09-20 00:18:23	+LambdaComplex	okay don't answer that because there's definitely some resemblance
2018-09-20 00:18:45	+LambdaComplex	we put our kindergarten pictures next to each other one time and we could've passed for siblings

2018-09-20 00:19:00	+dysfigured	i have only minimal exposure and experience with haskell, and it's power is immediately obvious to me. it is a difficult language to get into, i won't argue that

2018-09-20 00:20:03	+dysfigured	i mean, my programming experience almost entirely consists of php->javascript->bash->more javascript
2018-09-20 00:20:28	+brooks	yeah but you don't learn languages, you learn paradigms and methodology etc 
2018-09-20 00:20:31	+dysfigured	i've played with some haskell-ish inspired js libs like ramda and sanctuary
2018-09-20 00:20:45	+sj1k	I imagine its like python, if you fall in line and use it like they want you to then it's fucking good

2018-09-20 00:21:54	+dysfigured	i just think you might over estimate how much koolaid drinking i've done and how much experience i have outside my narrow little webdev bubble
2018-09-20 00:22:23	+LambdaComplex	what flavor was the koolaid?
2018-09-20 00:22:30	+brooks	in my experience, everyone asking about haskell thinks it's from another planet, and understanding why it's good without learning specialized vocabulary seems impossible
2018-09-20 00:22:37	+brooks	grape is best koolaid

2018-09-20 00:24:25	+LambdaComplex	go do so
2018-09-20 00:24:27	+dysfigured	brooks: that's definitely fair. haskell is difficult to learn because it's almost re-learning what it means to program, the fundamental building blocks are completely different and your previous programming experiences mean exactly shit
2018-09-20 00:24:42	+darkwater	i wish functional programming was more common tbh
2018-09-20 00:24:45	+darkwater	i mean pure fp

2018-09-20 05:23:55	+dysfigured	sj1k: stack basically gives you automatic per-project venvs

2018-09-20 05:24:46	+sj1k	oooh
2018-09-20 05:26:26	+dysfigured	but crucially, it handles ghc installtions as well, so that you can guarantee your project is using the right ghc version

2018-09-20 05:33:07	+dysfigured	abstract data types in haskell really blew my mind
2018-09-20 05:33:52	+dysfigured	but i'm still stuck in this weird stage where i can read haskell code fairly well but i can't write it for shit
2018-09-20 05:34:22	+sj1k	It's strange to write
2018-09-20 05:34:26	+sj1k	That's fo sure.
2018-09-20 05:37:34	+sj1k	haskell seems to be built in such a way where my bad habbits just never surface
2018-09-20 05:37:57	+sj1k	I guess ill get a whole new set of those, though.
2018-09-20 05:42:13	+sj1k	dysfigured, do you know if there is something like pythons '{}'.format()  in haskell?
2018-09-20 05:42:51	+sj1k	oh, probably printf
2018-09-20 05:51:09	+dysfigured	yeah, import Text.Printf and  :i printf  and :t PrintfType
2018-09-20 05:51:24	+dysfigured	you're fast approaching the extent of my knowledge

2018-09-20 10:25:30	+Kirjava	it is worse
2018-09-20 10:25:50	+Kirjava	eventually I was like "have you searched the internet?" "yeah" "what did it say?"
2018-09-20 10:26:08	+Kirjava	then there was a very telling pause while I presume he searched the internet, because he replied with the solution
2018-09-20 10:26:25	+Kirjava	"why did you ask me what to do if you already knew?"
2018-09-20 10:27:19	+Kirjava	I just linked smart-questions.html
2018-09-20 10:27:24	+Kirjava	I doubt it'll be of much use
2018-09-20 10:28:54	+FreeFull	But why solve your own problems when you can ask someone else to do it for you? :V

2018-09-20 11:59:32	+Kirjava	first one ends in an empty block statement, so the result value is the function at the start

2018-09-20 18:00:55	+dysfigured	the only ethical programming is pure functional programming. no classes, no state.
2018-09-20 18:12:08	+cosarara	some problems are inherently stateful. You can write a function that takes a state and returns the new state, but that doesn't mean you stop thinking about state
2018-09-20 18:12:33	+dysfigured	state is a tool of oppression
2018-09-20 18:13:39	+cosarara	ah yes and the state has a monopoly on violence
2018-09-20 18:13:43	+cosarara	wasn't it?
2018-09-20 18:14:54	+dysfigured	*legal violence
2018-09-20 18:15:53	+kori	legitimate*
2018-09-20 18:16:07	+kori	the state has a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence
2018-09-20 18:16:23	+dysfigured	what's the difference
2018-09-20 18:17:50	+kori	In law, "legitimacy" is distinguished from "legality" (see also color of law). An action can be legal but not legitimate or vice versa it can be legitimate but not legal.
2018-09-20 18:17:52	+kori	Thomas Hilbink suggests that the power to compel obedience to the law, is derived from the power to sway public opinion, to the belief that the law and its agents are legitimate and deserving of this obedience.[1]
2018-09-20 18:17:54	+kori	Where as Tyler says, 'Legitimacy is ...a psychological property of an authority, institution, or social arrangement, that leads those connected to it to believe that it is appropriate, proper, and just’ (Tyler, 2006b: 375). Thus viewed, the legal legitimacy is the belief that the law and agents of the law are rightful holders of authority; that they have the right to dictate appropriate
2018-09-20 18:17:56	+kori	behaviour and are entitled to be obeyed; and that laws should be obeyed, simply because, that is the right thing to do (Tyler, 2006a; Tyler, 2006b; cf. Easton, 1965).[2]
2018-09-20 18:18:53	+kori	The monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force, also known as the monopoly on violence (German: Gewaltmonopol des Staates), is a core concept of modern public law, which goes back to Jean Bodin's 1576 work Les Six livres de la République and Thomas Hobbes' 1651 book Leviathan.[citation needed] As the defining conception of the state, it was first described in sociology by Max Weber in his
2018-09-20 18:18:55	+kori	essay Politics as a Vocation (1919).[1] Weber claims that the state is the "only human Gemeinschaft which lays claim to the monopoly on the legitimated use of physical force. However, this monopoly is limited to a certain geographical area, and in fact this limitation to a particular area is one of the things that defines a state."[2] In other words, Weber describes the state as any organization
2018-09-20 18:18:57	+kori	that succeeds in holding the exclusive right to use, threaten, or authorize physical force against residents of its territory. Such a monopoly, according to Weber, must occur via a process of legitimation.

2018-09-20 18:20:29	+brooks	cornerstone of liberal democracy
2018-09-20 18:20:41	+brooks	but liberal democracy isn't what people think it is
2018-09-20 18:21:03	+brooks	people we regard as liberal philosophers today were not
2018-09-20 18:21:15	+brooks	e.g. Hobbes 
2018-09-20 18:21:28	+brooks	Hobbes was a monarchist 
2018-09-20 18:21:34	+brooks	not a Democrat 
2018-09-20 18:22:04	+brooks	this is currently regarded as one of the justifications for the liberal state 
2018-09-20 18:22:05	+Nux	democracy is a joke
2018-09-20 18:22:25	+brooks	Hobbies was arguing against democracy, in favor of a monarchy
2018-09-20 18:23:05	+brooks	liberal democracy is designed to keep people from having real power, yeah
2018-09-20 18:23:31	+brooks	I highly rec Chomsky on this subject
2018-09-20 18:24:43	+Nux	also "two party deomcracy" is p much "you think you elect leaders, but big money controls both sides"
2018-09-20 18:25:37	+brooks	sorta 
2018-09-20 18:25:46	+brooks	historically it wasn't like this in the US
2018-09-20 18:25:56	+brooks	it's only after the 70s
2018-09-20 18:26:00	+brooks	60s
2018-09-20 18:26:15	+brooks	the Democratic party was the working class party
2018-09-20 18:26:22	+brooks	but it moved right
2018-09-20 18:26:39	+brooks	people who would have been Republicans became democrats
2018-09-20 18:26:54	+brooks	and the Republican party bad to rebuild its voter base 
2018-09-20 18:27:15	+brooks	so it began to appeal to demographics that had never been politicized before 
2018-09-20 18:27:34	+brooks	e.g. radically conservative Christians 
2018-09-20 18:28:02	+brooks	so the Democratic party is Republicans and the Republicans are off the deep end
2018-09-20 18:28:35	+brooks	s/Republicans are/Republican party is/
2018-09-20 18:30:05	+brooks	I mostly agree though, a two party system is necessarily faulty 
2018-09-20 18:30:16	+brooks	it ends up being a one party system with two factions

2018-09-20 22:30:24	+brooks	e.g. you can whitelist certain sites for an app and block all other web requests
2018-09-20 22:30:32	+brooks	xprivacylua is the successor, because xprivacy is discontinued

2018-09-20 23:46:58	+Kirjava	or any turing complete language is "responsible for XSS"
2018-09-20 23:47:09	+Kirjava	that's kinda of meaningless, don't you think?

2018-09-20 23:47:50	+Nux	not really because if something is using a lot of JS compared to other shit, an attacker is going to look at that as an attack point first than anything else

2018-09-20 23:48:26	+Kirjava	but then the problem isn't the language, it's the poularity of the language
2018-09-20 23:48:36	+Kirjava	*popularity
2018-09-20 23:48:41	+Nux	because of its history, it doesnt matter the cause of it being vuln, nor does it really matter the langauge, any language that has high attack vectors will be looked at first
2018-09-20 23:48:49	+Kirjava	and the fact that people will write vulnerable things
2018-09-20 23:48:56	+Nux	^
2018-09-20 23:48:57	+Kirjava	"high attack vectors"
2018-09-20 23:49:05	+Kirjava	you're conflating browsers and javascript again
2018-09-20 23:49:19	+Nux	omg you arent getting what im saying
2018-09-20 23:49:29	+Kirjava	I am, I just don't think it's very meaningful
2018-09-20 23:49:39	+Nux	the browser uses JS, yes the browser could be the cause. i stated up there it was irrelevant

2018-09-20 23:50:04	+Nux	what is relevant things implemented for JS are usually fucked off. so they look there first.
2018-09-20 23:50:25	+Kirjava	well you were saying that JavaScript is a bad idea because it's vulnerable to security issues
2018-09-20 23:50:37	+Kirjava	I've just been explaining how that is not exactly correct
2018-09-20 23:50:48	+Nux	and ive been agreeing with taht over and over
2018-09-20 23:51:03	+Kirjava	can you reiterate the main point you have
2018-09-20 23:51:58	+Nux	that JS is a bad idea in the sense a lot of shit that goes with it is vuln (regardless of who how or why) use something just as capable but not widely used.. security by obscurity
2018-09-20 23:52:35	+Nux	the same reason i dont want "year of the linux desktop" to ever happen
2018-09-20 23:52:55	+Kirjava	but that doesn't make JavaScript a bad idea... because none of those problems are the fault of JavaScript
2018-09-20 23:53:07	+Nux	ik
2018-09-20 23:53:12	+Kirjava	it seems you're making the argument that any programming language is a bad idea
2018-09-20 23:53:17	+Nux	yes
2018-09-20 23:53:28	+Nux	the internet in general is a bad idea
2018-09-20 23:53:28	+Kirjava	then I cannot help you listen to reason
2018-09-20 23:53:30	+Kirjava	:)
2018-09-20 23:53:45	+Nux	yet we are putting everything on the internet

2018-09-21 00:04:22	+brooks	just because it's not javascript's fault doesn't mean it's a good idea to build sec stuff in javascript
2018-09-21 00:04:39	+brooks	this is the same argument against C
2018-09-21 00:05:09	+brooks	it's not *exactly* C's fault so many vulnerabilities in software could be mitigated by using a safer language, but it's still a good idea to move toward safer languages
2018-09-21 00:05:25	+Kirjava	did you know that mozilla have been rewriting some of the security stuff in the browser that used to be in C++ in JavaScript instead because it's a memory safe language
2018-09-21 00:05:42	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-21 00:06:00	+Kirjava	that's moving to rust now, but they were moving towards JS because it's a safe language
2018-09-21 00:06:06	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-21 00:06:10	+Kirjava	and at the time, yes, it was a good idea to do so
2018-09-21 00:06:27	+brooks	I'm not disagreeing with that, but I thought I might be able to make a more uhhh
2018-09-21 00:06:32	+brooks	amenable, version of nux's argument
2018-09-21 00:06:51	+Kirjava	I think you're saying something different to nux
2018-09-21 00:07:17	+Kirjava	+brooks | just because it's not javascript's fault doesn't mean it's a good idea to build sec stuff in javascript
2018-09-21 00:07:34	+Kirjava	why would it make it a bad idea
2018-09-21 00:07:41	+Kirjava	the problems are unrelated to the language itself
2018-09-21 00:07:49	+Kirjava	use another dynamic language and you will face the same problems
2018-09-21 00:08:03	+Kirjava	so I don't understand the issues attributed to the language in regards to security
2018-09-21 00:09:12	+brooks	I think Nux is comparing JS to languages that should exist rather than do exist
2018-09-21 00:09:27	+Nux	^
2018-09-21 00:09:35	+Kirjava	but *any* language
2018-09-21 00:09:36	+Nux	that and also use something not as widely used
2018-09-21 00:09:42	+Kirjava	even ones that *should* exist
2018-09-21 00:09:46	+Kirjava	will face the same problems
2018-09-21 00:09:53	+Kirjava	because the issues are not in the language
2018-09-21 00:10:07	+Kirjava	they are in poor implementations, or issues with security models of the environment
2018-09-21 00:10:12	+Nux	the issue is people not writing it correctly
2018-09-21 00:10:22	+Nux	like i said more documentation is needed
2018-09-21 00:10:24	+brooks	I don't think he's using a literal meaning of the term language either
2018-09-21 00:10:26	+Kirjava	which again is unrelated to the language
2018-09-21 00:10:26	+brooks	that is to say
2018-09-21 00:10:35	+brooks	javascript isn't just the language proper, it's everything that comes with it
2018-09-21 00:10:39	+Nux	^
2018-09-21 00:11:07	+Kirjava	agreed! what are the other things that come with it that would not be aspects of some other language
2018-09-21 00:11:10	+Kirjava	are there any?
2018-09-21 00:11:13	+Kirjava	I believe not
2018-09-21 00:11:38	+brooks	I mean yeah
2018-09-21 00:11:43	+bdelloid	JavaScript is like women
2018-09-21 00:11:53	+bdelloid	it's not just boobs and ass, they have an annoying person attached to it too
2018-09-21 00:12:01	+brooks	take the languages built to replace javascript, many of them help mitigate security issues
2018-09-21 00:12:14	+Kirjava	could you point to an example
2018-09-21 00:12:55	+Kirjava	you do have a point, if there was a escapeXSS() method, that would improve it for people that suck at dealing with XSS
2018-09-21 00:13:29	+brooks	purescript is a functional language heavily inspired by haskell, makes it a lot harder for race conditions and such to exist
2018-09-21 00:13:46	+Kirjava	and elm is a language that doesn't have runtime errors
2018-09-21 00:13:49	+brooks	elm is designed heavily inspired by, I think ocaml? it does similarly
2018-09-21 00:13:51	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-21 00:13:59	+brooks	elm is amazing in this regard
2018-09-21 00:14:01	+Kirjava	but elm/purescript are both vulnerable to the same XSS
2018-09-21 00:14:07	+Kirjava	the XSS poor implementations
2018-09-21 00:14:11	+Kirjava	and the same webIDL sploits
2018-09-21 00:14:16	+brooks	they don't have to be
2018-09-21 00:14:22	+Kirjava	but they do!
2018-09-21 00:14:24	+Kirjava	that's the point
2018-09-21 00:14:30	+brooks	not nux's point
2018-09-21 00:14:40	+Kirjava	the code is executed in an environment where these things exist
2018-09-21 00:14:48	+Kirjava	your complaint, again, is about browser
2018-09-21 00:14:55	+Nux	https://thenewstack.io/node-js-creator-blasts-node-js-offers-a-secure-typescript-based-alternative/
2018-09-21 00:14:55	+Kirjava	not about the language executed on browser
2018-09-21 00:15:03	+Kirjava	lmao deno
2018-09-21 00:15:12	+brooks	php and python are executed in the same environment too, and one of them *does* have tools to mitigate large classes of security issues
2018-09-21 00:15:26	+Kirjava	I'm talking specifically about frontend code here
2018-09-21 00:15:33	+Kirjava	because those were the exploits we were talking about
2018-09-21 00:15:35	+Kirjava	XSS, etc
2018-09-21 00:16:08	+Kirjava	but sure, some languages are better than others are providing users the tools for dealing with escaping user input on the backend
2018-09-21 00:16:13	+brooks	wow ryan dahl is alive
2018-09-21 00:16:18	+Kirjava	yes
2018-09-21 00:16:21	+Kirjava	he popped up to say
2018-09-21 00:16:22	+brooks	he disappeared after a rant about hating computers
2018-09-21 00:16:24	+brooks	years ago
2018-09-21 00:16:32	+Kirjava	"lets remove everything that made nodejs great"
2018-09-21 00:16:59	+brooks	I mostly just wanted to point out that like
2018-09-21 00:17:23	+brooks	the nature of the argument going on here wasn't "we both understand the strongest version of the opposite argument and now we're starting to discuss nuance"
2018-09-21 00:17:27	+sj1k	Morning
2018-09-21 00:17:40	+brooks	it was more like that hadn't been established yet
2018-09-21 00:17:48	+brooks	morning sj1k 
2018-09-21 00:17:58	+ym	morning sj1k
2018-09-21 00:18:03	+Kirjava	sure. but invalid points were being reiterated
2018-09-21 00:18:12	+bdelloid	I'm an invalid point
2018-09-21 00:18:13	+Nux	https://sdtimes.com/angular/security-vulnerabilities-javascript-libraries-hard-avoid/
2018-09-21 00:18:14	+Kirjava	so I found myself explaining why they were incorrect
2018-09-21 00:19:00	+Nux	>According to a study conducted by Northeastern University, “more than 37% of websites use at least one library version with a known vulnerability.”
2018-09-21 00:19:27	+brooks	yeah I don't quite disagree with what you were saying, but I think you misunderstood the vantage point Nux was arguing from
2018-09-21 00:19:33	+Kirjava	using a library with a known vulnerability != having a website that is vulnerable
2018-09-21 00:19:35	+brooks	I think I get your vantage point a little easier
2018-09-21 00:19:57	+Nux	Kirjava: i have said that numerous times
2018-09-21 00:20:17	+Kirjava	maybe I did. but I scroll up and read what has been said and still think it is definitely wrong
2018-09-21 00:20:22	+Nux	still doesnt mean some determined person couldnt figure out a way to exploit it at some point
2018-09-21 00:20:33	+Kirjava	yes it does
2018-09-21 00:20:39	+Nux	lol k
2018-09-21 00:20:46	+Kirjava	include vbulnerable version of jquery.js on a website
2018-09-21 00:20:49	+Kirjava	add no other code
2018-09-21 00:20:58	+Kirjava	cannot be exploited via the vulnerability in the library
2018-09-21 00:21:11	+brooks	gotta agree with that yeah
2018-09-21 00:21:20	+brooks	the vulnerable component of the library may not be in use at all
2018-09-21 00:21:34	+brooks	that being said
2018-09-21 00:21:44	+brooks	37% is way too high even knowing it's a false high
2018-09-21 00:21:51	+Nux	k ill just SE the fucking admin into running something locally, while they are auth'd as admin. grab some shit
2018-09-21 00:21:58	+Nux	cause thats never been done before or anything
2018-09-21 00:22:02	+Kirjava	maybe the main problem is the low barrier to entry
2018-09-21 00:22:10	+Kirjava	total fucking morons work in web dev
2018-09-21 00:22:16	+Kirjava	I'm surprised the figure isn't higher
2018-09-21 00:22:18	+brooks	like php back in its day
2018-09-21 00:22:49	+Nux	>The JavaScript ecosystem does not have a robust framework for documenting vulnerabilities within libraries and documenting their effect,” Arnal Dayaratna, research director at IDC, told SD Times. There is no cohesive list of known vulnerabilities that is available for developers to access. JQuery vulnerabilities show up on the CVE website, which is a directory of common security
2018-09-21 00:22:52	+Nux	vulnerabilities. However, Angular does not show up on the CVE; it instead uses GitHub CHANGELOG to report security vulnerabilities. Every library handles security information differently, therefore developers cannot rely on a single location to get updated. 
2018-09-21 00:23:06	+Nux	D O C U M E N T A T I ON
2018-09-21 00:23:53	+Kirjava	is your argument just that people don't always write secure code?
2018-09-21 00:24:00	+Kirjava	because "javascript is bad" is not the right way to frame that
2018-09-21 00:24:09	+Nux	no
2018-09-21 00:24:12	+Nux	omg
2018-09-21 00:24:36	+Kirjava	is it that people should be better informed?
2018-09-21 00:24:41	+Kirjava	because again, see above
2018-09-21 00:25:18	+Nux	its third party libs being pushed out as vuln, thats being used on millions of sites, which you say "doesnt mean they are vuln" well guess what SOME ARE or it wouldnt be an issue, it wouldnt be reported. and for a place pushing out code for millions of sites to use THEY SHOULD make secure code, apparently it isnt that easy to do, or we wouldnt have this issue
2018-09-21 00:25:50	+Kirjava	right, but this doesn't mean javascript is bad, or particularly poor wrt security
2018-09-21 00:26:03	+Nux	its still a by product
2018-09-21 00:26:29	+Kirjava	of javascript? no. it's a by product of implementations that people have done
2018-09-21 00:26:55	+Kirjava	there's nothing special about javascript that makes it bad for security
2018-09-21 00:27:00	+Kirjava	agree/disagree?
2018-09-21 00:27:05	+Nux	agree
2018-09-21 00:27:21	+Nux	but still it is JS shit that leads to major breaches
2018-09-21 00:27:24	+Nux	so its gonna get heat
2018-09-21 00:27:25	+Kirjava	then why start the argument with "javascript is bad for security"? :)
2018-09-21 00:27:34	+Nux	because it is
2018-09-21 00:27:43	+Nux	from an attackers POV thats where im gonna look first
2018-09-21 00:27:47	+Kirjava	but you just disagreed with that... what the fack
2018-09-21 00:28:11	+Nux	no i dont disagree with it
2018-09-21 00:28:17	+Nux	you arent grasping what im saying
2018-09-21 00:28:23	+Nux	yes its not the languages fault
2018-09-21 00:28:54	+Nux	but at the same time the languages name, makes attackers eyes light up, because they know, more than likely they will find an issue
2018-09-21 00:29:11	+Nux	or else mage cart wouldnt be spreading like it is
2018-09-21 00:29:19	+Kirjava	that's just because it's the language of the web
2018-09-21 00:29:21	+Nux	or xss wouldnt be as prevelant
2018-09-21 00:29:25	+Nux	yes
2018-09-21 00:29:26	+Kirjava	it's their *only* option
2018-09-21 00:29:32	+Nux	not really tho
2018-09-21 00:29:35	+Nux	there are alts
2018-09-21 00:29:38	+Kirjava	this does not mean javascript is bad for security
2018-09-21 00:29:43	+Nux	other ways to do things
2018-09-21 00:29:47	+Nux	it might not be quick
2018-09-21 00:29:51	+Nux	it might take time also
2018-09-21 00:30:00	+Nux	but less of a chance of getting popped
2018-09-21 00:30:59	+Nux	because there are non JS versions of sites with full funnctionality for .onion's. so obviously there are alts
2018-09-21 00:31:18	+dysfigured	why is only jQuery on CVE, and not other libraries like Express or Koa for example
2018-09-21 00:31:35	+dysfigured	who gets to decide what goes on CVE

2018-09-21 00:33:34	+sj1k	Haven't done much more since yesterday
2018-09-21 00:33:42	+sj1k	But finished off that code I showed you
2018-09-21 00:33:54	+Kirjava	+Kirjava | there's nothing special about javascript that makes it bad for security 
2018-09-21 00:33:54	+Kirjava	    +Nux | agree
2018-09-21 00:33:54	+Kirjava	+Kirjava | then why start the argument with "javascript is bad for security"? :)
2018-09-21 00:33:54	+Kirjava	    +Nux | because it is
2018-09-21 00:33:57	+Kirjava	this really confused me
2018-09-21 00:34:04	+sj1k	I'm very happy with a certain recursive func I made
2018-09-21 00:34:17	+Nux	Kirjava: you are missing my point
2018-09-21 00:34:25	+Nux	there is nothing bad about the language for sec shit
2018-09-21 00:34:33	+Nux	but its use is linked to major breaches
2018-09-21 00:34:38	+Nux	so at the sametime it is

2018-09-21 00:34:47	+Nux	not because of the langugage its self though
2018-09-21 00:34:58	+Nux	i dont get why you arent grasping that
2018-09-21 00:35:02	+Kirjava	ok, I think your phrasing is making it hard to understand
2018-09-21 00:35:09	+Kirjava	because you're saying something then saying the opposite
2018-09-21 00:35:11	+Nux	ya im literally autistic
2018-09-21 00:35:22	+Nux	its hard for me to put shit into words

2018-09-21 00:35:29	+Nux	suck at that*
2018-09-21 00:35:36	+Kirjava	I mean sure there are things that are exploited via javascript
2018-09-21 00:35:45	+Kirjava	but that doesn't even reflect badly on the language
2018-09-21 00:35:56	+Kirjava	because it's due to some other issue
2018-09-21 00:35:57	+Nux	it does tho
2018-09-21 00:36:01	+Kirjava	no it doesn't
2018-09-21 00:36:09	+Kirjava	because *no* language would prevent these kinds of issues
2018-09-21 00:36:10	+Nux	no it does, should it
2018-09-21 00:36:12	+Nux	no
2018-09-21 00:36:14	+Nux	but it does
2018-09-21 00:36:42	+Kirjava	if it reflects badly, that is misplaced and based on a misunderstand
2018-09-21 00:36:47	+Kirjava	*misunderstanding
2018-09-21 00:37:32	+Kirjava	*it doesn't reflect badly unless you misunderstand what the problem is
2018-09-21 00:37:38	+Nux	its like the same thing with java and tomcat and .war files, a lot of that shit gets popped so it gets a bad rap, but its purely because its implemented wrong
2018-09-21 00:38:04	+Kirjava	right so... javascript isn't bad for security

2018-09-21 00:38:39	+Kirjava	I mean the first thing you said in this conversation was literally an attack on the language itself

2018-09-21 00:40:00	+Kirjava	what were you referring to when you said this;
2018-09-21 00:40:03	+Nux	but the fact it is linked (through w/e kind of way) to major breaches
2018-09-21 00:40:08	+Kirjava	 +Nux | no it is bad
2018-09-21 00:40:15	+Nux	means it gets looked at a vector
2018-09-21 00:40:16	+Kirjava	after I said "javascript isn't bad"
2018-09-21 00:40:20	+Nux	and with good success
2018-09-21 00:40:29	+Nux	its not the language, but its misuse
2018-09-21 00:40:51	+Nux	you cant try an attack vector if it doesnt exist
2018-09-21 00:40:56	+Kirjava	right so... when I said "javascript isn't bad for security"
2018-09-21 00:41:05	+Nux	nvm
2018-09-21 00:41:09	+Kirjava	dont' say "no it is bad"
2018-09-21 00:41:13	+Nux	you are clearly not grasping what im saying
2018-09-21 00:41:15	+Nux	at all
2018-09-21 00:41:17	+Kirjava	if you don't mean the language is bad
2018-09-21 00:41:17	+Nux	like 0
2018-09-21 00:41:26	+Nux	the USE of it is
2018-09-21 00:41:35	+Nux	the wrong USE of it leads to major shit
2018-09-21 00:41:39	+Kirjava	indeed
2018-09-21 00:41:44	+Nux	so yes its bad
2018-09-21 00:41:46	+Nux	for security
2018-09-21 00:41:47	+Kirjava	but that's not the fault of the language
2018-09-21 00:41:49	+Nux	because of that
2018-09-21 00:41:57	+Nux	its a huge attack vector
2018-09-21 00:41:57	+Kirjava	the security issues have NOTHING to do with the language
2018-09-21 00:42:03	+Nux	rm it, you rm'd a major vector

2018-09-21 00:42:15	+Nux	you did

2018-09-21 00:42:22	+Kirjava	remove javascript, the issues are still there
2018-09-21 00:42:31	+Kirjava	you use alternative languages to leverage them
2018-09-21 00:42:48	+Nux	yes but the attack vectors are limited
2018-09-21 00:42:51	+Kirjava	no they aren't
2018-09-21 00:43:00	+Kirjava	you have the exact same vectors with WASM as you do with JS
2018-09-21 00:43:12	+Nux	then use something else besides that

2018-09-21 00:45:37	+Nux	and ill show you the HS shit
2018-09-21 00:46:20	+Kirjava	I just think the phrasing you are using is bad
2018-09-21 00:46:35	+Kirjava	it's like you're putting the blame on JS when JS is just a means to an end
2018-09-21 00:46:51	+Kirjava	it could be anything else that has the same problem
2018-09-21 00:47:15	+Kirjava	if you think that makes JS the problem, or want to say JS is at fault
2018-09-21 00:47:20	+Kirjava	that's fine
2018-09-21 00:47:34	+Kirjava	but I disagree because the problem lies outside of that domain
2018-09-21 00:47:55	+Kirjava	I know you're saying that it's because of people misusing it
2018-09-21 00:48:00	+Kirjava	or not being taught correctly
2018-09-21 00:48:07	+Kirjava	or lack of documentation
2018-09-21 00:48:09	+Kirjava	and not the language
2018-09-21 00:48:26	+Kirjava	the problem I have is when you still put the blame on the language because it's an attack vector
2018-09-21 00:48:45	+Kirjava	this I believe is misdirected
2018-09-21 00:50:42	+Kirjava	it's an implementation issue, an issue with shit programmers - javascript is not at fault for the problems that have been described
2018-09-21 00:51:49	+Kirjava	like, there has been no RCE caused by a poorly written version of the spec
2018-09-21 00:52:01	+Kirjava	RCE is cause by a poor implementation of that spec

2018-09-21 00:53:13	+Kirjava	once WASM is more popular the same issues are going to crop up with it that crop up with js
2018-09-21 00:53:21	+Kirjava	does that mean WASM is to blame for the problems?
2018-09-21 00:53:23	+Kirjava	of course not
2018-09-21 00:53:34	+Nux	no youre missing the point, attacker like magecart sees JS site, and is like ohh baby. starts digging, they see no JS site.. move one
2018-09-21 00:53:40	+Nux	thats what makes it the issue
2018-09-21 00:54:12	+Kirjava	yes
2018-09-21 00:54:21	+Kirjava	and if they saw a blank page with no HTML or CSS
2018-09-21 00:54:25	+Kirjava	they would move on too
2018-09-21 00:54:36	+Kirjava	if they saw a site with HTML and WASM, they would start digging
2018-09-21 00:54:45	+Kirjava	this is not something that is uniquely javascript
2018-09-21 00:55:17	+Kirjava	so you can't blame javascript for it
2018-09-21 00:55:33	+Nux	well if they exploit is specifically for JS
2018-09-21 00:55:36	+Nux	then
2018-09-21 00:56:07	+Kirjava	I believe anything that affects JS will also affect WASM
2018-09-21 00:56:37	+Kirjava	because they both implement webIDL (for things like XSS issues)
2018-09-21 00:56:42	+Kirjava	or are vulnerable to faulty implementations
2018-09-21 00:57:50	+Kirjava	I mean it's fine to disagree
2018-09-21 00:57:54	+Nux	ya but if you can make a full functional site without JS, why not just do that
2018-09-21 00:57:56	+Kirjava	I think the blame is misplaced
2018-09-21 00:58:01	+Nux	i understand some things need it
2018-09-21 00:58:11	+Nux	but why use it on shit that has better alternatives

2018-09-21 03:04:37	+sj1k	xD
2018-09-21 03:05:02	+dysfigured	in js i would write compose as    (f, g) => x => f(g(x))
2018-09-21 03:05:28	+sj1k	I guess composing is what confuses me
2018-09-21 03:05:32	+dysfigured	compose(fnA, fnB)  but in haskell you can just fnA . fnB
2018-09-21 03:06:21	+dysfigured	it's basically just, take these two functions and make a new function from them
2018-09-21 03:09:20	+ym	ah you have to partially apply it `bonus words = unique . possible words`
2018-09-21 03:09:34	+dysfigured	def inc(n): return n + 1;  def square(n): return n * n;     def incAndSquare(n): return inc(square(n))
2018-09-21 03:10:41	+dysfigured	so you have two unary functions, and a third that uses them both
2018-09-21 03:11:08	+dysfigured	in haskell (omitting the definitions), you could write incAndSquare = inc . square
2018-09-21 03:11:12	+sj1k	yeah that makes sense, so it can't be the composition thats confusing me
2018-09-21 03:11:42	+sj1k	bonus words word = unique . possible words     makes the code where I use bonus freak out. But the func itself checks out
2018-09-21 03:12:05	+dysfigured	you've already surpassed me my man, i've really only dabbled with haskell

2018-09-21 03:13:21	+sj1k	Ah
2018-09-21 03:13:25	+ym	you partially apply `possible` to `words` because . can't handle functions that take too arguments without crazy stuff
2018-09-21 03:13:32	+sj1k	RIght yeah
2018-09-21 03:14:00	+ym	s/too/two
2018-09-21 03:14:21	+dysfigured	my thought was, your original function was   bonus ws w = unique $ possible ws w     but since you're just applying all provided arguments to the last function, you'd be able to use currying..
2018-09-21 03:15:04	+dysfigured	also, words is a function in the prelude

2018-09-21 03:16:09	+Arathnim	Allowing Haskell to resolve possible-ambiguous function application by type and arity would make the language a lot harder to use.
2018-09-21 03:18:39	+dysfigured	tru
2018-09-21 03:19:49	+sj1k	and the type for bonus should just be [String] -> String -> [String]  right?
2018-09-21 03:20:26	+dysfigured	i think so. i'm having a terrible time understanding what this does
2018-09-21 03:21:41	+sj1k	the bonus is meant to use a list of words and another word and find out how many valid words can be made from removing a single letter from word
2018-09-21 03:23:18	+sj1k	bonus(boats) -> ["oats","bats","bots","boas","boat"]     for example
2018-09-21 03:24:36	+sj1k	bonus boats *
2018-09-21 03:25:03	+dysfigured	lol yeah it's weird getting used to fn application not needing parens
2018-09-21 03:27:52	+dysfigured	but given   bonus "boats" if it returns an array of strings, i'd think the type sig would just be   bonus :: String -> [String]
2018-09-21 03:28:05	+dysfigured	you can use ghcmod to insert types for you if you hook it up to your editor
2018-09-21 03:29:40	+dysfigured	we #haskell now
2018-09-21 03:33:28	+dysfigured	a function with the type of  [String] -> String -> [String]   would be a binary function, accepting an array of strings and a string and returns an array of strings
2018-09-21 03:34:30	+dysfigured	if it helps to "unhaskell" type sigs, consider [mentally] replacing the last -> with "returning" and all the other -> with commas
2018-09-21 03:35:06	+dysfigured	well, unless they're wrapper in parens, in which case you have to apply that kinda thing eh recursively i guess
2018-09-21 03:35:12	+dysfigured	s/wrapper/wrapped
2018-09-21 03:37:50	+dysfigured	sj1k: so basically the idea is given [a huge wordlist database to work with and] some string, find out what words you can make with those letters?
2018-09-21 03:37:59	+sj1k	yes
2018-09-21 03:38:11	+dysfigured	is that just the bonus part or the whole thing

2018-09-21 04:06:20	+dysfigured	man, i got this cognac aged in a bourbon cask, it's so fuckin tasty y'all holy shit
2018-09-21 04:06:23	+Arathnim	As an example:
2018-09-21 04:07:04	+Arathnim	funnel s t = elem t (filter (length == length s - 1) subsequences s)
2018-09-21 04:07:26	+Arathnim	Which is invalid because of how it resolves function application and lambdas.
2018-09-21 04:07:52	+dysfigured	length == length s   just seems odd af like what
2018-09-21 04:08:18	+Arathnim	It's filtering for things where the length is equal to the length of s minus 1.
2018-09-21 04:09:25	+Arathnim	I find it easier to read than the explicit lambdas, anyway.
2018-09-21 04:09:35	+dysfigured	yeah, i think that's what's throwing me
2018-09-21 04:09:58	+dysfigured	sometimes explicit is good
2018-09-21 04:11:29	+dysfigured	wouldn't the "correct" version be something like  unnel s t = elem t (filter (\x length x == length s - 1) subsequences s)

2018-09-21 04:12:09	+Arathnim	funnel s t = elem t (filter (\x -> length x == length s - 1) (subsequences s))
2018-09-21 04:12:18	+dysfigured	last i see from you before is   I find it easier to read than the explicit lambdas, anyway. 
2018-09-21 04:12:29	+dysfigured	oh right, the -> too

2018-09-21 04:13:16	+Arathnim	Also, the parens around 'subsequences s', otherwise it'll apply the functions incorrectly.
2018-09-21 04:13:35	+dysfigured	slightly annoying, but totally makes sense why it's required

2018-09-21 04:27:14	+Arathnim	It certainly does, although the idea is to make it easier to express correct programs, at the cost of error checking for a few cases. A good tradeoff if you're unlikely to make type errors; but not for beginners, who are more likely to stumble onto edge cases, and learn faster with more solid rules and less magic.

2018-09-21 05:09:54	+winny	not really :s
2018-09-21 05:10:23	+winny	works 98% of the time

2018-09-21 05:11:15	+dysfigured	i need a name for this kind of bias, where you think thing are "wrong" because they don't conform your specific use-case/perspective

2018-09-21 05:14:57	+brooks	quantum broke some of the features I relied on dozens or hundreds of times per day
2018-09-21 05:17:37	+brooks	idk about "work fine"
2018-09-21 05:17:55	+brooks	for example I now have to hit tab to unfocus the url bar. I have to hit ctrl+l to focus it, instead of o

2018-09-21 05:22:10	+dysfigured	vim vixen is p nice
2018-09-21 05:23:32	+brooks	I don't even use one now since they broke my workflow
2018-09-21 05:23:47	+brooks	the basic way I interacted with my browser is gone
2018-09-21 05:24:55	+brooks	I tried vim vixen for a while but I just didn't care anymore
2018-09-21 05:25:20	+brooks	I had to reach for my mouse so often as it was, I'd rather not constantly feel like my workflow is being broken
2018-09-21 05:25:36	+winny	i hate computers brooks 
2018-09-21 05:25:51	+brooks	me too
2018-09-21 05:25:56	+winny	u with me?
2018-09-21 05:26:16	+brooks	kinda
2018-09-21 05:26:23	+ym	Nothing really compares to cvim for chrome
2018-09-21 05:26:30	+brooks	I also see javascript as the last line of defense I have against a predatory web
2018-09-21 05:27:15	+brooks	I wonder if servo will ever rise from the dead
2018-09-21 05:31:42	+dysfigured	ym: wrong
2018-09-21 05:31:56	+dysfigured	vimperator was the best thing ever. cvim is absolute shit in comparison
2018-09-21 05:33:21	+dysfigured	cvim is okay for chrome, vim vixen is the best i've found for quantum (and still better than cvim, fuck chrome's no ricing the ui bullshit). but vimperator was the best browser experience ever

2018-09-21 05:33:47	+winny	use a keyboard first browser

2018-09-21 09:12:40	+Kirjava	the quantum project is basically "what can we move from servo to firefox"
2018-09-21 09:18:51	+Kirjava	so far we got stylo, and webrender is coming next
2018-09-21 09:19:09	+Kirjava	dunno when that'll be though
2018-09-21 09:19:30	+Kirjava	every time I enable webrender in preview editions I get issues atm. doesn't seem stable at all
2018-09-21 09:32:14	+FreeFull	The problem with the old addon API is that it exposed a lot of internal details in a way that made it hard to change them
2018-09-21 09:34:01	+Kirjava	yea, which would massively slow down progress
2018-09-21 09:37:30	+FreeFull	A funny side-effect if the new API is that now you can share the same code between your Chrome addon and Firefox addon

2018-09-21 15:30:13	+Kirjava	sticking with the old addons api would eventually entirely kill firefox as it totally loses velocity
2018-09-21 15:31:01	+brooks	I agree with you, I'm not complaining about the end of xul
2018-09-21 15:31:06	+Kirjava	oh
2018-09-21 15:31:26	+Kirjava	IIRC, mozilla have created a webview component for android based on servo
2018-09-21 15:31:43	+Kirjava	which opens up a few possibilities
2018-09-21 15:31:51	+Kirjava	but I think servo is mainly just for experiments
2018-09-21 15:31:54	+brooks	is servo ever going to be an alternative to webkit?
2018-09-21 15:32:12	+Kirjava	you mean gecko
2018-09-21 15:32:18	+Kirjava	right?
2018-09-21 15:32:26	+brooks	no
2018-09-21 15:32:36	+brooks	I mean webkit
2018-09-21 15:32:43	+brooks	that's the promise of servo
2018-09-21 15:32:55	+brooks	that we can make browsers without resorting to webkit
2018-09-21 15:33:06	+brooks	and without making our own
2018-09-21 15:33:08	+Kirjava	I mean, gecko is already an alternative to webkit
2018-09-21 15:33:26	+Kirjava	but I guess it's heavily tied to FF
2018-09-21 15:33:40	+Kirjava	gecko based browsers tend to just be forks of FF
2018-09-21 15:33:45	+brooks	I don't mean in the sense that it's also a browser engine yeah
2018-09-21 15:33:47	+brooks	yeah 
2018-09-21 15:34:00	+Kirjava	yeah, that would be nice
2018-09-21 15:34:13	+Kirjava	I'd like to see electron but servo based
2018-09-21 15:34:22	+Kirjava	(it already exists but is not mature enough to use)
2018-09-21 15:34:42	+bdelloid	I'd like to see cancer, but with ketchup
2018-09-21 15:34:42	+Kirjava	I don't know what the future holds for servo
2018-09-21 15:34:47	+brooks	they changed the direction of servo a while ago 
2018-09-21 15:35:02	+brooks	and downsized the team 
2018-09-21 15:35:07	+Kirjava	bdelloid: electron is a valid choice of dev environment in certain situations
2018-09-21 15:35:17	+Kirjava	it's just often chosen when it shouldn't be
2018-09-21 15:35:32	+Kirjava	brooks: to what, just to move stuff into FF now?
2018-09-21 15:35:43	+bdelloid	Kirjava, cancer is a valid choice of death in certain situations
2018-09-21 15:36:21	+brooks	they dropped the standalone browser engine and made it part of their web VR project 
2018-09-21 15:36:21	+Kirjava	bdelloid: your analogy is correct if you see all forms of software development as bad
2018-09-21 15:36:28	+Kirjava	and if so we will never agree on this subject
2018-09-21 15:36:40	+bdelloid	no, just browser as a toolkit
2018-09-21 15:36:42	+Kirjava	brooks: that's... weird

2018-09-21 15:37:20	+Kirjava	yes, and that's what servo's version of electron would basically be

2018-09-21 15:40:59	+Kirjava	ugh i need to alias /close to /wc already
2018-09-21 15:41:18	+brooks	wc?
2018-09-21 15:41:25	+Kirjava	brooks: I mean #2 looks like it's still happening so
2018-09-21 15:41:35	+Kirjava	just long term
2018-09-21 15:41:42	+brooks	I mean supposedly 
2018-09-21 15:41:44	+Kirjava	/wc is what /close is in irssi
2018-09-21 15:41:51	+Kirjava	it's always been a long term goal
2018-09-21 15:41:59	+brooks	I'm pretty sad about this though, I wanted servo based electron too
2018-09-21 15:42:04	+Kirjava	I mean
2018-09-21 15:42:07	+Kirjava	it's happening
2018-09-21 15:42:11	+Kirjava	it's just not mature yet
2018-09-21 15:42:14	+brooks	I'm doubtful it is
2018-09-21 15:42:25	+Kirjava	BUT I JUST LINKED PROJECTS THAT IT IS
2018-09-21 15:42:45	+brooks	this ids fundamentally new direction for the project, it doesn't reply make sense as part of that trajectory
2018-09-21 15:42:52	+brooks	is a*
2018-09-21 15:43:06	+Kirjava	not for mozilla, no
2018-09-21 15:43:12	+Kirjava	that doesn't mean a third party won't pick it up
2018-09-21 15:43:26	+Kirjava	like, electron isn't a google product
2018-09-21 15:44:07	+brooks	being on the roadmap has nothing to do with whether or not the standalone engine is ever happening, then/though
2018-09-21 15:44:58	+brooks	I had limn bookmarked before I lost my bookmarks I think
2018-09-21 15:45:18	+brooks	it looks really cool

2018-09-21 15:49:53	+Kirjava	brooks: true enough. you can still take advantage of servo without it being the standaalone engine though
2018-09-21 15:50:02	+Kirjava	brooks: why don't we build it :3
2018-09-21 15:52:22	+brooks	I wanted to use servo to make my perfect browser, but now I gotta make servo :(
2018-09-21 15:53:03	+brooks	I'll think about it though, I agree with bdelloid's comment the other day
2018-09-21 15:53:11	+Kirjava	oh, what was that
2018-09-21 15:53:19	+brooks	"don't let your dreams be memes" lmao
2018-09-21 15:54:41	+Kirjava	heh
2018-09-21 15:55:06	+Kirjava	webkit being the only choice at the moment further contributes to the terrible browser monoculture
2018-09-21 15:55:26	+Kirjava	why are mozilla even doing webvr

2018-09-21 15:56:21	+brooks	relatedly, I apologize if I step on your toes here
2018-09-21 15:56:46	+brooks	I can tell this is near and dear to you, and I don't want to like, push off my cynicism on you or anything
2018-09-21 15:57:12	+brooks	it's just it's near and dear to me too in kind of the opposite way, where I was much more excited about a year and a half ago
2018-09-21 15:59:30	+Kirjava	no need to worry about that
2018-09-21 15:59:41	+Kirjava	I brim with optimism
2018-09-21 16:00:02	+brooks	...nice
2018-09-21 16:01:07	+Kirjava	maybe it's to a fault
2018-09-21 16:01:31	+brooks	maybe not
2018-09-21 16:01:57	+brooks	I became cynical the more I learned, and I'm trying to get that optimism back
2018-09-21 16:06:44	+bdelloid	optimism comes from enjoying awful things
2018-09-21 16:09:50	+brooks	tbh no
2018-09-21 16:11:00	+LambdaComplex	optimism comes from realizing nothing matters, including the fact that nothing matters :3
2018-09-21 16:12:35	+brooks	optimism has plenty of sources, but anti-optimism as a value/worldview is pretty much necessarily illness
2018-09-21 16:18:51	+brooks	is there a tool for comparing different kernel .config files?
2018-09-21 16:20:09	+trinary	sort and diff?
2018-09-21 16:20:29	+brooks	that's what I'm doing
2018-09-21 16:20:44	+brooks	but I'd prefer something else
2018-09-21 16:20:59	+brooks	....I feel like we had a very similar conversation not too long ago
2018-09-21 16:21:07	+brooks	or I did, anyway
2018-09-21 16:22:36	+Kirjava	optimism can just be a personality trait
2018-09-21 16:22:42	+Kirjava	(• ◡•)
2018-09-21 16:24:29	+trinary	brooks - How about the diffconfig script in "scripts"
2018-09-21 16:25:36	+brooks	thanks!

2018-09-21 16:30:05	+brooks	diffconfig seems like it mostly just sorts and diffs, but it does show the changes
2018-09-21 16:30:25	+brooks	like e.g. y -> m
2018-09-21 16:30:29	+brooks	or m -> y
2018-09-21 16:30:53	+brooks	or n -> y
2018-09-21 17:25:18	+Nux	hi #code
2018-09-21 17:27:39	+Kirjava	you can't blame the language for things outside of it's control
2018-09-21 17:27:42	+Kirjava	*its
2018-09-21 17:27:54	+Kirjava	fucking hate the apostrophe edge case for 'its'
2018-09-21 17:28:16	+cosarara	it's not an edge case
2018-09-21 17:28:23	+cosarara	it's a different word
2018-09-21 17:28:47	+Kirjava	I mean in the way that you should add a possessive apostrophe
2018-09-21 17:28:53	+Kirjava	if it was someone's name
2018-09-21 17:29:03	+Kirjava	you'd say "john's thing"
2018-09-21 17:29:16	+cosarara	and you'd say "their thing"
2018-09-21 17:29:20	+cosarara	or "his thing"
2018-09-21 17:29:23	+cosarara	not "he's thing"
2018-09-21 17:29:32	+cosarara	or "her thing", not "she's thing"
2018-09-21 17:29:33	+Kirjava	ah, that makes more sense to me
2018-09-21 17:30:12	+Kirjava	always found it irksome
2018-09-21 17:30:42	+cosarara	I find general English spelling to be really chaotic, but apostrophes are more or less ok
2018-09-21 17:30:46	+Kirjava	so you only use a posessive when it's a noun and not a pronoun
2018-09-21 17:30:58	+Kirjava	*possessive
2018-09-21 17:31:37	+cosarara	that sounds right yes
2018-09-21 17:31:47	+cosarara	in german they skip the '
2018-09-21 17:31:52	+Kirjava	soundrels
2018-09-21 17:31:55	+Kirjava	*scoundrels
2018-09-21 17:32:05	+Kirjava	OK GOTTA GO NOW THOUGH WORK IS OVER AND TRAIN INC
2018-09-21 17:32:05	+Kirjava	BYE
2018-09-21 17:32:43	+cosarara	bb
2018-09-21 17:35:41	+brooks	possessive pronouns yeah
2018-09-21 17:36:12	+brooks	his, hers, theirs, ours, mine, its 
2018-09-21 17:36:42	+brooks	I think of pronouns as sets 
2018-09-21 17:36:50	+brooks	subject, object, possessive

2018-09-22 01:36:56	+winny	i doubt it
2018-09-22 01:37:01	+winny	it's unrealistic
2018-09-22 01:38:18	+brooks	how so
2018-09-22 01:38:37	+winny	you have a huge repository of python packages
2018-09-22 01:38:46	+winny	each has a different author
2018-09-22 01:38:53	+winny	there is no real control
2018-09-22 01:39:09	+winny	there is no real way to offer authenticity
2018-09-22 01:39:21	+winny	without enforcing changes on the community
2018-09-22 01:39:45	+brooks	who has write access to the repos? the authors?
2018-09-22 01:40:04	+brooks	s/the authors/the respective authors/
2018-09-22 01:40:13	+winny	my point is there isn't really any point unless they do it globally
2018-09-22 01:40:28	+winny	because you could make it optional, and it'd be of little value
2018-09-22 01:40:55	+winny	you couldn't really verify the authenticity of everything you install without it for every python package
2018-09-22 01:41:20	+winny	im kind of talking out my ass
2018-09-22 01:41:35	+brooks	mostly what I want is to verify that there's no MITM between me and the pypi site
2018-09-22 01:41:53	+winny	but it seems managing lots of packages in any system, outside of having very stringent policies, authenticity is the first thing to go
2018-09-22 01:42:13	+brooks	authenticity is pretty variable
2018-09-22 01:42:20	+winny	hell, even archlinux didn't have it until recently
2018-09-22 01:42:25	+winny	but they do it wrong anyway
2018-09-22 01:42:33	+winny	it's hell
2018-09-22 01:42:43	+winny	every once in awhile your keyring is literally fucked
2018-09-22 01:42:45	+brooks	the whl files in particular are binary package builds, produced by a build server afaict
2018-09-22 01:42:50	+winny	but lets not talk about a terrible linux distro
2018-09-22 01:42:55	+brooks	so verifying those on download would help more than a little
2018-09-22 01:43:17	+winny	brooks: in that case you have a great point
2018-09-22 01:43:21	+winny	:3
2018-09-22 01:43:31	+winny	u should visit ##python and be like bitch give me da sig
2018-09-22 01:45:19	+brooks	pip is weird
2018-09-22 01:45:26	+winny	yeah
2018-09-22 01:45:39	+brooks	they've been fighting against doing any kind of verification like this for like 5 years or something
2018-09-22 01:45:57	+brooks	originally, there wasn't even https
2018-09-22 01:45:59	+winny	i think i hate computers
2018-09-22 01:46:06	+brooks	same
2018-09-22 01:46:19	+brooks	what did you mean about arch, aside from the keyring?
2018-09-22 01:46:39	+winny	i want to give meaningful bullet points about that
2018-09-22 01:46:45	+winny	but i don't think i have it in me
2018-09-22 01:46:51	+winny	it's beating a very dead horse
2018-09-22 01:48:21	+winny	i need to write an essay about it
2018-09-22 01:48:39	+winny	i am really opnionated about what a distro should be, but im no sircmpwn 
2018-09-22 01:50:12	+sircmpwn	you can fix your arch keyring in a single command
2018-09-22 01:50:52	+brooks	what distro do u use winny 
2018-09-22 01:51:58	+brooks	I would read that essay
2018-09-22 01:51:59	+winny	gentoo on my personal machines, but pretty happy with using debian/ubuntu for server tasks
2018-09-22 01:53:56	+winny	idk if gentoo is something i'd recommend to any old user tho
2018-09-22 01:54:22	+winny	i really like the work that has been put into nixos
2018-09-22 01:54:28	+winny	on paper sounds like perfect distro
2018-09-22 01:54:46	+sircmpwn	on paper it sounds like a hellish nightmare
2018-09-22 01:54:51	+winny	:3
2018-09-22 01:55:17	+brooks	how so
2018-09-22 01:55:19	+brooks	@ both
2018-09-22 01:55:36	+winny	nix is very complicated
2018-09-22 01:55:38	+sircmpwn	it's ridiculously complicated
2018-09-22 01:55:45	+sircmpwn	and complicated systems break and are hard to fix when they do
2018-09-22 01:56:06	+winny	it often requires a lot of specific knowledge about nix to fix, i suspect
2018-09-22 01:56:19	+sircmpwn	also, nix suffers heavily from the functional programming disease
2018-09-22 01:56:27	+winny	lol
2018-09-22 01:56:31	+winny	i don't mind that bit
2018-09-22 01:56:33	+brooks	>fp is bad
2018-09-22 01:56:45	+sircmpwn	that's not what I said
2018-09-22 01:56:56	+sircmpwn	alcohol is fun and can be used responsibly, but alcoholism is a thing
2018-09-22 01:57:04	+sircmpwn	same applies to fp
2018-09-22 01:58:02	+brooks	alright, how does nix abuse fp
2018-09-22 01:58:21	+sircmpwn	by designing a system around it
2018-09-22 01:59:12	+brooks	why would that be bad considering fp is about making it easier to manage state
2018-09-22 01:59:27	+sircmpwn	applying functional principles to make it easier to manage state is fine
2018-09-22 01:59:57	+sircmpwn	but nix is just the whole fuckin banana
2018-09-22 02:00:29	+sircmpwn	I don't know how to articulate it but there's clearly a difference between someone who appreciates and undersatnds functional programming and uses it sparingly and someone who sleeps with it
2018-09-22 02:01:06	+brooks	how does this not just come back to "actually using fp is mostly bad"
2018-09-22 02:01:09	+winny	speaking of alcoholism
2018-09-22 02:01:11	+sircmpwn	it's all an illusion, computers are procedural machines and when the tire hits the pavement you'll have to deal with it
2018-09-22 02:01:20	+winny	tfw can't afford to go out and get a bottle of vodka ;-;
2018-09-22 02:01:21	+sircmpwn	using fp languages is mostly bad
2018-09-22 02:01:56	+brooks	alrighty then
2018-09-22 02:02:21	+brooks	tfw
2018-09-22 02:02:26	+brooks	I wish I had some liquor
2018-09-22 02:02:33	+sircmpwn	iktf
2018-09-22 02:02:46	+sircmpwn	I have some vodka but I'd rather have a beer tbh
2018-09-22 02:03:01	+brooks	trade you
2018-09-22 02:03:06	+brooks	I have beer but I'd rather have vodka
2018-09-22 02:03:08	+winny	i have like $60 until end of month
2018-09-22 02:03:08	+sircmpwn	deal
2018-09-22 02:03:11	+winny	can't afford :x
2018-09-22 02:03:12	+brooks	it's shit beer tho
2018-09-22 02:03:18	+sircmpwn	that's the other thing about functional programmers, they're all broke
2018-09-22 02:03:26	+winny	ahahaha
2018-09-22 02:03:35	+winny	that or academics
2018-09-22 02:03:46	+brooks	aren't academics broke too
2018-09-22 02:03:54	+winny	lol touche
2018-09-22 02:04:06	+brooks	tfw
2018-09-22 02:04:12	+sircmpwn	there is a significant intersection between academics and fp users
2018-09-22 02:04:21	+sircmpwn	unsuprisingly acadmics largely write shit code too
2018-09-22 02:04:26	+sircmpwn	academics*
2018-09-22 02:04:28	+winny	the herpes of cs perhaps
2018-09-22 02:04:37	+winny	actually no
2018-09-22 02:04:42	+winny	that'd be machine learning
2018-09-22 02:05:26	+sircmpwn	fp is the leprosy of cs
2018-09-22 02:05:46	+sircmpwn	brb gonna buy some lemonade to mix with this vodka
2018-09-22 02:06:13	+winny	MAN
2018-09-22 02:06:44	+winny	sircmpwn: btw idk what happened by my alpine based docker image for bitlbee ate all my disk ;-;
2018-09-22 02:11:59	+winny	also sircmpwn thoughts on netplan? u used it?

2018-09-22 02:24:20	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: netplan is Canonical's Latest Great Idea On How To Make Ubuntu Great
2018-09-22 02:24:25	+LambdaComplex	or some shitposty thing like that
2018-09-22 02:24:30	+sircmpwn	if you highlight me I'll talk in most channels
2018-09-22 02:24:37	+winny	LambdaComplex: it's what ubuntu ships with to replace using debian's interfaces
2018-09-22 02:24:40	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: tldr you configure your network interfaces with yaml files
2018-09-22 02:24:45	+sircmpwn	that sounds pretty bad
2018-09-22 02:24:46	+winny	oops, that was for sircmpwn 
2018-09-22 02:24:50	+LambdaComplex	yeah i know that! but i haven't scrolled up to see if you were highlighted
2018-09-22 02:24:58	+winny	upside, it's yaml
2018-09-22 02:25:04	+winny	downside, yet another configuration tool
2018-09-22 02:25:04	+LambdaComplex	downside, it's yaml
2018-09-22 02:25:06	+LambdaComplex	:^)
2018-09-22 02:25:10	+sircmpwn	imo networks should be configured by a little script that runs at startup and just invokes the ip command to set your IP address and routes up
2018-09-22 02:25:25	+sircmpwn	or a lil' dhcp daemon
2018-09-22 02:25:33	+winny	it talks to either networkmanager or systemd's network thing
2018-09-22 02:25:43	+winny	so naturally meme
2018-09-22 02:25:57	+LambdaComplex	so, normally i'd probably complain about how starting up/managing services should be handled by something more robust than a bunch of shell scripts, and i'd probably say something about how i like that systemd can actually handle that stuff
2018-09-22 02:25:58	+LambdaComplex	but
2018-09-22 02:26:08	+LambdaComplex	i have to admit configuring networking on openbsd is REALLY comfy
2018-09-22 02:26:15	+LambdaComplex	(freebsd too, i think?)
2018-09-22 02:26:16	+sircmpwn	is there anything more robust than shell scripts, though
2018-09-22 02:26:18	+winny	actually made ubuntu server shit itself
2018-09-22 02:26:40	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: depends on how shitty they are i suppose
2018-09-22 02:26:54	+winny	i had changed my vm's interface to internal interface (no dhcp available) and it literally hanged at configuring network
2018-09-22 02:26:54	+sircmpwn	I don't think you need some kind of framework for doing this in
2018-09-22 02:27:14	+sircmpwn	I literally mean a 2-4 line shell script which just invokes ip(8) a few times
2018-09-22 02:27:16	+winny	i had to ctrl+alt+delete, revert the vm configuration, then fix the configuration in the vm to use a static ip
2018-09-22 02:27:36	+winny	i was surprised ctrl+alt+delete worked
2018-09-22 02:27:40	+winny	systemd is weird
2018-09-22 02:28:06	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: openbsd vs freebsd
2018-09-22 02:28:09	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: what's your take
2018-09-22 02:28:16	+sircmpwn	not meaningful
2018-09-22 02:28:18	+winny	an amazing amount of systemd units don't really handle failure or timeouts gracefully, i think intentionally because systemd has facilities for both
2018-09-22 02:28:22	+sircmpwn	I don't have enough experience with openbsd
2018-09-22 02:28:24	+sircmpwn	but I don't like freebsd
2018-09-22 02:28:27	+winny	LambdaComplex: they aren't really comparable
2018-09-22 02:28:28	+sircmpwn	ports is bad
2018-09-22 02:28:41	+LambdaComplex	winny: EXPLAIN
2018-09-22 02:28:45	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: what's wrong with ports
2018-09-22 02:28:57	+winny	the projects have different goals
2018-09-22 02:29:00	+sircmpwn	on a fresh freebsd install I once went to ports to install git
2018-09-22 02:29:02	+sircmpwn	default options
2018-09-22 02:29:13	+sircmpwn	an hour later it was halfway through compiling clang
2018-09-22 02:29:17	+winny	lol
2018-09-22 02:29:18	+sircmpwn	an hour after that it was working on X
2018-09-22 02:29:24	+LambdaComplex	winny: doesn't mean you can't use them for the same stuff though
2018-09-22 02:29:28	+winny	yeah freebsd feature selection is really bad
2018-09-22 02:29:33	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: wew
2018-09-22 02:29:45	+sircmpwn	bsd kernel is nice though
2018-09-22 02:29:54	+winny	also the cohesive base system
2018-09-22 02:29:54	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: why not just pkg_add
2018-09-22 02:30:03	+winny	LambdaComplex: u mean pkg(8)
2018-09-22 02:30:03	+LambdaComplex	cohesive base system a bae <3
2018-09-22 02:30:05	+sircmpwn	why ship a dumb ports system
2018-09-22 02:30:05	+winny	:3
2018-09-22 02:30:17	+LambdaComplex	winny: m-maybe
2018-09-22 02:30:28	+sircmpwn	bsd kernel with alpine userspace minus openrc minus busybox plus sbase plus ubase plus something better for init
2018-09-22 02:30:33	+sircmpwn	would be pretty fucking good
2018-09-22 02:30:39	+winny	wew sircmpwn u sound like 100% meme

2018-09-22 02:31:41	+LambdaComplex	neat!
2018-09-22 02:31:48	+sircmpwn	someday I'll fork the 9front kernel, throw out most of the userspace, make ape not shit, and build the OS to end all OSes
2018-09-22 02:31:50	+LambdaComplex	or just run freebsd and use jails :^)
2018-09-22 02:31:59	+winny	nah
2018-09-22 02:32:04	+winny	freebsd jails are sort of not really robust

2018-09-22 02:32:54	+winny	it's pretty new
2018-09-22 02:33:02	+LambdaComplex	fair enough
2018-09-22 02:33:10	+winny	it seems good
2018-09-22 02:33:22	+winny	but i wouldn't trust it given kvm can do everything better
2018-09-22 02:33:44	+LambdaComplex	mfw kvm is the only hypervisor that libvirt decently supports

2018-09-22 02:37:25	+brooks	not too long after I started using it, there was a bug where a lot of packages got broken because of a build tool that was broken?
2018-09-22 02:37:41	+brooks	oh right I remember
2018-09-22 02:37:46	+brooks	long file path names
2018-09-22 02:37:51	+brooks	didn't get built into the packages
2018-09-22 02:37:54	+brooks	lmao

2018-09-22 02:38:03	+LambdaComplex	what about nix
2018-09-22 02:38:07	+brooks	so npm was broken
2018-09-22 02:38:07	+LambdaComplex	er...nixos 
2018-09-22 02:38:12	+sircmpwn	nixos is bad

2018-09-22 02:38:16	+sircmpwn	we talked about that

2018-09-22 02:38:20	+sircmpwn	LFS sucks
2018-09-22 02:38:22	+brooks	but it was broken because of the OS!
2018-09-22 02:38:22	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: does this mean i have to scroll up
2018-09-22 02:38:24	+sircmpwn	have you ever actually gone through it
2018-09-22 02:38:31	+brooks	LFS is just a garbage tutorial
2018-09-22 02:38:33	+winny	sircmpwn: no im being ironic
2018-09-22 02:38:37	+brooks	90% copy/pasting
2018-09-22 02:38:41	+brooks	I thought it would be really cool
2018-09-22 02:38:55	+winny	it seemed cool to me too but i didn't see the purpose
2018-09-22 02:39:01	+brooks	well
2018-09-22 02:39:05	+brooks	back in the olden days
2018-09-22 02:39:08	+brooks	of the early 90s
2018-09-22 02:39:17	+sircmpwn	they have really dumb defaults and make a bunch of really contrived choices
2018-09-22 02:39:20	+brooks	a sizable portion of linux users didn't use distros, they made their own
2018-09-22 02:39:22	+sircmpwn	and you end up with a system you can't use
2018-09-22 02:39:49	+LambdaComplex	okay i scrolled up and read stuff
2018-09-22 02:39:49	+brooks	but the first-time-user-experience was using a distro
2018-09-22 02:40:09	+brooks	so LFS seems like a good opportunity to demistify linux
2018-09-22 02:40:10	+winny	yall heard of T2?
2018-09-22 02:40:16	+LambdaComplex	wow brooks don't you know that copy/pasting text and then watching text scroll on your screen is how you become a haxx0r?
2018-09-22 02:40:18	+brooks	but it doesn't really do that
2018-09-22 02:40:28	+winny	some weird toolkit for building custom linux installations for whatever use
2018-09-22 02:40:34	+brooks	I haven't
2018-09-22 02:40:43	+winny	it seemed cool but much over the top
2018-09-22 02:40:58	+brooks	I think I read that knoppix? or something, is a tool for making distros now
2018-09-22 02:40:59	+LambdaComplex	so today i solved an issue where a program's log files weren't being rotated
2018-09-22 02:41:04	+winny	eh
2018-09-22 02:41:12	+winny	knoppix is just a specialized livecd based off debian iirc
2018-09-22 02:41:13	+brooks	and funtoo's metro is a tool for creating your own stage3's with the portage build tree
2018-09-22 02:41:32	+brooks	stage3s? without apostrophe? idk
2018-09-22 02:41:42	+winny	brooks: dw we know what u mean
2018-09-22 02:41:44	+brooks	I wanna check out T2
2018-09-22 02:41:46	+LambdaComplex	turned out that the log directory was sgid so the log files were getting created with the wrong group so logrotate was failing to set ownership
2018-09-22 02:41:52	+LambdaComplex	and was failing to move the files
2018-09-22 02:41:56	+brooks	holy shit
2018-09-22 02:41:57	+LambdaComplex	AREN'T COMPUTERS GREAT
2018-09-22 02:41:58	+brooks	lmao
2018-09-22 02:42:09	+winny	so
2018-09-22 02:42:12	+LambdaComplex	brooks: was the holy shit @ me
2018-09-22 02:42:15	+brooks	yes
2018-09-22 02:42:16	+winny	what's the weirdest or craziest linux distro
2018-09-22 02:42:18	+LambdaComplex	o ok
2018-09-22 02:42:26	+LambdaComplex	yeah /var/log/icinga2 was nagios:adm and sgid
2018-09-22 02:42:27	+winny	let's livestream installing ubuntu warty warthog (4.10)

2018-09-22 02:42:31	+LambdaComplex	but logrotate was using nagios:nagios
2018-09-22 02:42:36	+sircmpwn	you either go to a rescue shell in the initrd or the full banana
2018-09-22 02:42:38	+LambdaComplex	>error: error setting owner of /var/log/icinga2/icinga2.log.1.gz to uid 107 and gid 33: Operation not permitted
2018-09-22 02:42:41	+LambdaComplex	verbose mode ftw
2018-09-22 02:42:59	+brooks	no one, the stage3s are just how you bootstrap the installation
2018-09-22 02:43:02	+brooks	they're leftover
2018-09-22 02:43:19	+brooks	gentoo, funtoo, void, and presumably some others are still installed using the stage3 but nothing else
2018-09-22 02:43:28	+brooks	s/nothing else/not the other stages/
2018-09-22 02:43:34	+brooks	exherbo too I think
2018-09-22 02:43:36	+LambdaComplex	i think there's a few stage4s for gentoo now
2018-09-22 02:43:42	+brooks	what is stage4
2018-09-22 02:43:49	+LambdaComplex	more shit installed i think
2018-09-22 02:44:00	+LambdaComplex	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Stage_tarball#Stage_4
2018-09-22 02:44:38	+brooks	oh wtf
2018-09-22 02:44:47	+brooks	I never saw this
2018-09-22 02:44:48	+brooks	cool
2018-09-22 02:44:58	+brooks	also psa: I am a poser and I don't know anything about this
2018-09-22 02:45:36	+LambdaComplex	install gentoo
2018-09-22 02:45:44	+brooks	I did last year
2018-09-22 02:46:00	+brooks	my initramfs was borked and I never got it working
2018-09-22 02:48:11	+brooks	so I borrowed a working one
2018-09-22 02:48:14	+brooks	and then like
2018-09-22 02:48:33	+brooks	I couldn't figure out where to find documentation for different tools/sets of tools
2018-09-22 02:49:26	+brooks	it was confusing
2018-09-22 02:52:29	+LambdaComplex	and that's why you should just install a BSD
2018-09-22 02:52:34	+LambdaComplex	and use its cohesive base system
2018-09-22 02:52:42	+LambdaComplex	literally everything you need to make your computer a router is installed by default!!
2018-09-22 02:52:53	+LambdaComplex	(even ospfd and bgpd!)
2018-09-22 02:54:43	+brooks	kek
2018-09-22 02:54:52	+brooks	I'd like to try out freebsd someime
2018-09-22 02:54:56	+brooks	sometime
2018-09-22 02:55:02	+brooks	on a machine that's not a daily driver
2018-09-22 02:55:14	+brooks	but is openbsd a meme
2018-09-22 02:57:06	+LambdaComplex	....maybe?
2018-09-22 02:57:09	+LambdaComplex	what does that even mean
2018-09-22 02:57:20	+LambdaComplex	i'm using openbsd right now! kinda! for something!
2018-09-22 02:57:27	+LambdaComplex	because my computer has an openbsd gateway
2018-09-22 02:57:29	+LambdaComplex	because why not
2018-09-22 03:00:20	+brooks	it's super security focused and all that
2018-09-22 03:00:32	+brooks	and supposedly they do all kinds of experiments and shit
2018-09-22 03:00:41	+brooks	I don't Trust it for some reason
2018-09-22 03:01:46	+LambdaComplex	what reason is that
2018-09-22 03:04:19	+brooks	I don't know
2018-09-22 03:04:21	+brooks	something about it
2018-09-22 03:04:27	+brooks	oh I know
2018-09-22 03:05:08	+brooks	it's because I never hear about it from people I already respect in security, but I don't actually know of many people in security to begin with, so it's definitely a useless impression
2018-09-22 03:05:17	+Arathnim	I've been thinking about zero-trust models lately. Especially on the problem of verifying those models to prople who can't verify theose properties themselves.
2018-09-22 03:05:53	+winny	ohhi Arathnim 
2018-09-22 03:07:06	+Arathnim	hi winnyfriend
2018-09-22 03:07:10	+winny	:3
2018-09-22 03:16:33	+LambdaComplex	okay
2018-09-22 03:16:36	+LambdaComplex	wishbone ash
2018-09-22 03:16:38	+LambdaComplex	is _really good_
2018-09-22 03:16:39	+brooks	how do you get zero-trust with hardware
2018-09-22 03:16:41	+brooks	wishbone ash?
2018-09-22 03:16:51	+LambdaComplex	rock band from the 70s
2018-09-22 03:17:06	+LambdaComplex	well
2018-09-22 03:17:10	+LambdaComplex	they're still active?
2018-09-22 03:17:20	+winny	lolololol https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2018/09/19/freebsd-desktop-part-16-configuration-pause-any-application/
2018-09-22 03:17:34	+LambdaComplex	but i'm listening to their second album now
2018-09-22 03:17:40	+LambdaComplex	which is from 1971
2018-09-22 03:18:41	+LambdaComplex	well that was definitely in 7/4
2018-09-22 03:19:13	+LambdaComplex	was pretty proggy
2018-09-22 03:19:21	+LambdaComplex	and this song sounds like blues
2018-09-22 03:19:26	+LambdaComplex	swing beat on the guitar
2018-09-22 03:19:37	+LambdaComplex	oh, drums are doing the swing beat now too
2018-09-22 03:19:40	+LambdaComplex	nice
2018-09-22 03:22:41	+LambdaComplex	okay this is pretty standard early 70s blues-inspired rock
2018-09-22 03:22:43	+LambdaComplex	I LIKE IT
2018-09-22 03:23:08	+LambdaComplex	reminds me of alvin lee's shit
2018-09-22 03:23:11	+LambdaComplex	that's a good thing
2018-09-22 03:24:17	+Arathnim	brooks: You mean, how do we get zero-trust procedures in spite of the fact that our code runs on untrustworthy hardware?
2018-09-22 03:24:52	+brooks	or how do we get trustworthy hardware, yeah
2018-09-22 03:28:12	+Arathnim	Encryption can do it, at the cost of 99.9% of your computing time, or we can harden against hardware hacks, ideally, tamper-resistant features, and the hardware design tested by a group with very strong incentives to find flaws.
2018-09-22 03:41:56	+LambdaComplex	that lick reminded me of blackmore
2018-09-22 03:41:58	+LambdaComplex	NICE
2018-09-22 03:42:44	+Cosumu	i see
2018-09-22 03:42:48	+sircmpwn	speaking of trustworthy hardware
2018-09-22 03:42:53	+sircmpwn	my risc-v machine should arrive next month
2018-09-22 03:43:05	+LambdaComplex	hey sircmpwn what's your favorite 70s rock band
2018-09-22 03:43:21	+sircmpwn	pink floyd
2018-09-22 03:43:25	+LambdaComplex	good answer
2018-09-22 03:43:51	+sircmpwn	I was once a psychonaut, there's really no other answer
2018-09-22 03:44:30	+LambdaComplex	...grateful dead?
2018-09-22 03:44:32	+LambdaComplex	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-09-22 03:44:36	+sircmpwn	2/10
2018-09-22 03:44:40	+LambdaComplex	kek
2018-09-22 03:44:48	+LambdaComplex	yeah i'm not much of a dead fan
2018-09-22 03:44:53	+LambdaComplex	a few of their songs are really good
2018-09-22 03:44:56	+LambdaComplex	everything else is just eh
2018-09-22 03:44:59	+LambdaComplex	and repetitive
2018-09-22 03:45:01	+LambdaComplex	and eh
2018-09-22 03:45:23	+Cosumu	im not a fan of being dead no
2018-09-22 03:45:33	+Uncled1023	Green Day Master Race, don't @ me
2018-09-22 03:45:42	+Cosumu	.kb Uncled1023 
2018-09-22 03:45:43	+sircmpwn	christ
2018-09-22 03:45:51	+LambdaComplex	wow Uncled1023 are you a 15 year old girl
2018-09-22 03:45:56	+Uncled1023	y-yes
2018-09-22 03:45:57	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-22 03:45:58	+Cosumu	from 15 yeras ago
2018-09-22 03:46:05	+LambdaComplex	well in that case that answer is ok
2018-09-22 03:46:39	+Cosumu	but if he is 15 from 15 years ago
2018-09-22 03:46:42	+Cosumu	u r 30
2018-09-22 03:46:51	+Uncled1023	almost 28
2018-09-22 03:47:49	+LambdaComplex	hey sircmpwn i'm gonna link you to a song soon because it probably has pink floyd influences
2018-09-22 03:47:56	+sircmpwn	noted
2018-09-22 03:48:02	+LambdaComplex	but i can't remember if it's part 2 or part 3 with the great guitar solo
2018-09-22 03:49:18	+sircmpwn	just found this https://redd.it/9hrkyj
2018-09-22 03:49:26	+sircmpwn	>Who cares about a niche project from abusive developer?
2018-09-22 03:49:27	+LambdaComplex	it is apparently part 2 with the great guitar solo
2018-09-22 03:49:31	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y_zaOFO15U
2018-09-22 03:49:31	+meep	"New Age Krautrock Symphony p. 2"
2018-09-22 03:49:32	+sircmpwn	gonna print it out and frame it
2018-09-22 03:49:34	+LambdaComplex	fucking love this album
2018-09-22 03:49:42	+sircmpwn	*click*
2018-09-22 03:49:50	+LambdaComplex	don't even ask me what genre this is
2018-09-22 03:49:55	+LambdaComplex	i'm just gonna say "...krautrock?"
2018-09-22 03:50:06	+LambdaComplex	their earlier stuff was probably best categorized as italo disco
2018-09-22 03:50:12	+LambdaComplex	but this is from like 2001
2018-09-22 03:50:22	+sircmpwn	it sounds like psychedellic rock
2018-09-22 03:50:28	+LambdaComplex	the newer stuff is like....psychedelic rock with lots of synth shit?
2018-09-22 03:50:32	+LambdaComplex	and pink floyd influences/???
2018-09-22 03:50:35	+LambdaComplex	idk man
2018-09-22 03:50:37	+LambdaComplex	shamall is weird
2018-09-22 03:50:42	+sircmpwn	have you seen tan(x)
2018-09-22 03:50:48	+sircmpwn	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUy7OCnhD94
2018-09-22 03:50:49	+meep	"tan(x) [60 FPS]"
2018-09-22 03:51:43	+LambdaComplex	nope
2018-09-22 03:51:49	 *	LambdaComplex clicks
2018-09-22 03:52:01	+LambdaComplex	is this anime
2018-09-22 03:52:11	+sircmpwn	it's an AMV, yeah
2018-09-22 03:52:24	+sircmpwn	but this guy does remarkably good AMVs, not the shit you usually see
2018-09-22 03:52:25	+LambdaComplex	trippy
2018-09-22 03:52:31	+Uncled1023	i prefer sin(y)
2018-09-22 03:52:33	+sircmpwn	re: krautrok, this is decent but it doesn't really compare to floyd
2018-09-22 03:52:51	+sircmpwn	I see the influences, though
2018-09-22 03:53:14	+LambdaComplex	i'm sure there's more floyd-influenced songs somewhere
2018-09-22 03:53:29	+LambdaComplex	LEMME CHECK TEH DISCOGRPAHY
2018-09-22 03:53:53	+sircmpwn	the lyrics are an important part of floyd
2018-09-22 03:54:34	+LambdaComplex	does endless river even have any lyrics
2018-09-22 03:54:36	+sircmpwn	normally I don't give a shit about lyrics, I only listen to foreign trash I can't understand
2018-09-22 03:55:19	+sircmpwn	though funny story today
2018-09-22 03:55:27	+sircmpwn	I was listening to some kpop and about a minute in realized something strange was going on
2018-09-22 03:55:36	+sircmpwn	I could understand what they were singing
2018-09-22 03:55:41	+sircmpwn	turns out they were singing in Japanese
2018-09-22 03:56:10	+sircmpwn	the lyrics were basically the korean take on the 1 semester of spanish spanish love song for japanese
2018-09-22 03:56:21	+LambdaComplex	kek
2018-09-22 03:57:18	+LambdaComplex	hey sircmpwn wanna hear the catchiest song ever
2018-09-22 03:57:26	+sircmpwn	I doubt you have it prepared
2018-09-22 03:57:32	+LambdaComplex	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yh9i0PAjck
2018-09-22 03:57:32	+meep	"Loituma - Ievan Polkka"
2018-09-22 03:57:34	+LambdaComplex	:^)
2018-09-22 03:57:38	+sircmpwn	...
2018-09-22 03:57:57	+LambdaComplex	you're not disagreeing with me!
2018-09-22 03:59:22	+LambdaComplex	finnish scat singing is objectively the catchiest thing ever
2018-09-22 03:59:25	+LambdaComplex	QED
2018-09-22 03:59:48	+sircmpwn	I'm not sure you know what scat is
2018-09-22 04:00:02	+LambdaComplex	i'm not sure you know what scat singing is
2018-09-22 04:00:09	+sircmpwn	you're right
2018-09-22 04:00:11	+sircmpwn	just read the wiki
2018-09-22 04:00:23	+yossarian	skibi dibbi do
2018-09-22 04:00:23	+LambdaComplex	see: the ending of ragdoll by aerosmith
2018-09-22 04:00:28	+LambdaComplex	or what yossarian just said
2018-09-22 04:00:31	+brooks	^
2018-09-22 04:00:38	+LambdaComplex	or that one part from roadhouse blues
2018-09-22 04:00:45	+yossarian	or just scatman john
2018-09-22 04:01:26	+LambdaComplex	what's that? listen to wishbone ash's third album? 
2018-09-22 04:01:28	+LambdaComplex	don't mind if i do
2018-09-22 04:03:26	+winny	hey sircmpwn dumb question lmao
2018-09-22 04:03:38	+winny	how do i modify user groups in alpine
2018-09-22 04:03:45	+sircmpwn	apk install shadow
2018-09-22 04:03:47	+sircmpwn	then do it normally
2018-09-22 04:03:50	+sircmpwn	fuck busybox user management
2018-09-22 04:04:01	+winny	wait does busybox have a command for it
2018-09-22 04:04:07	+sircmpwn	yeah, adduser et al
2018-09-22 04:04:11	+sircmpwn	aka garbage
2018-09-22 04:04:58	+winny	welp
2018-09-22 04:05:09	+winny	u mean apk add right
2018-09-22 04:05:12	+sircmpwn	yeah
2018-09-22 04:05:17	+sircmpwn	there's also the classic `vim /etc/passwd`
2018-09-22 04:05:18	+winny	weird, can't install shadow
2018-09-22 04:05:28	+sircmpwn	it's in edge
2018-09-22 04:05:32	+winny	well, i want the command to validate the crap i enter
2018-09-22 04:05:45	+sircmpwn	vim /etc/apk/repositories
2018-09-22 04:05:53	+sircmpwn	uncomment edge and add @edge before each line
2018-09-22 04:05:58	+sircmpwn	then you can do apk add shadow@edge
2018-09-22 04:06:18	+winny	is this on wiki, i'll just follow that
2018-09-22 04:06:34	+sircmpwn	yeah
2018-09-22 04:06:59	+sircmpwn	actual catchy song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiosKUO7oqo
2018-09-22 04:06:59	+meep	"Counting!!"
2018-09-22 04:11:30	+winny	this is weird
2018-09-22 04:11:39	+winny	alpine doesn't ship mksh with a proper mkshrc
2018-09-22 04:16:43	+sircmpwn	mksh is bad though
2018-09-22 04:26:37	+winny	wew
2018-09-22 04:27:12	+winny	apk info | grep -v -- -doc$ | while read; do apk info ${REPLY]-doc &> /dev/null && sudo apk add ${REPLY}-doc; done
2018-09-22 04:27:30	+sircmpwn	try doas over sudo
2018-09-22 04:27:49	+sircmpwn	the alpine package is maintained by yours truly
2018-09-22 04:28:11	+winny	lol
2018-09-22 04:28:19	+winny	that's a tall order cuz im a lazy cunt
2018-09-22 04:28:23	+winny	but just maybe
2018-09-22 04:28:27	+sircmpwn	man 8 sudoers
2018-09-22 04:28:35	+sircmpwn	>The sudoers file grammar will be described below in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).  Don't despair if you are unfamiliar with EBNF; it is fairly simple, and the definitions below are annotated.
2018-09-22 04:29:34	+winny	tbh it'd do better without the annotation
2018-09-22 04:30:04	+LambdaComplex	>8
2018-09-22 04:30:07	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: shouldn't that be 5?
2018-09-22 04:30:10	+sircmpwn	yes
2018-09-22 04:30:13	+sircmpwn	my b
2018-09-22 04:30:23	+winny	it's in 5 on my alpine install
2018-09-22 04:30:34	+LambdaComplex	yeah, 5 is for config files
2018-09-22 04:30:41	+LambdaComplex	8 is for binaries that are only gonna get used by the sysadmin
2018-09-22 04:30:51	+winny	wew
2018-09-22 04:30:53	+winny	should i install emacs
2018-09-22 04:30:58	+LambdaComplex	no
2018-09-22 04:31:00	+LambdaComplex	you should install vim
2018-09-22 04:31:01	+LambdaComplex	or neovim
2018-09-22 04:31:04	+LambdaComplex	or elvis
2018-09-22 04:31:06	+LambdaComplex	or vi
2018-09-22 04:31:08	+LambdaComplex	or pico :^)
2018-09-22 04:31:17	+winny	nvi is the best vi editor
2018-09-22 04:31:36	+LambdaComplex	wait a sec
2018-09-22 04:31:42	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: does alpine have doas by default
2018-09-22 04:31:44	+sircmpwn	no
2018-09-22 04:31:48	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-22 04:32:09	+LambdaComplex	i haven't looked into doas much but it seems really cool
2018-09-22 04:32:52	+winny	it's busybox vi
2018-09-22 04:33:04	+sircmpwn	vim is the best vi
2018-09-22 04:33:06	+sircmpwn	fite me
2018-09-22 04:33:09	+winny	pls
2018-09-22 04:33:17	+winny	too many features
2018-09-22 04:33:25	+sircmpwn	it's a mess but at least it's not emacs
2018-09-22 04:33:26	+LambdaComplex	neovim is best vi
2018-09-22 04:33:28	+winny	it feels like a minime emacs chublub

2018-09-22 04:33:46	+LambdaComplex	vim has async support now, right?
2018-09-22 04:33:49	+sircmpwn	yeah
2018-09-22 04:33:52	+LambdaComplex	thanks neovim
2018-09-22 04:34:03	+LambdaComplex	okay even if you prefer vim to neovim.....
2018-09-22 04:34:04	+LambdaComplex	one sec
2018-09-22 04:34:10	+winny	sircmpwn: been thinking about getting a very low spec portable machine to have slow feels
2018-09-22 04:34:18	+winny	alpine might be good these days on it
2018-09-22 04:34:22	+sircmpwn	reminder that neovim has literally taken thousands of dollars away from starving african children
2018-09-22 04:34:40	+sircmpwn	winny: x200 is <3
2018-09-22 04:34:46	+winny	no
2018-09-22 04:34:46	+brooks	implying
2018-09-22 04:34:52	+winny	i mean like real old
2018-09-22 04:34:55	+sircmpwn	oh
2018-09-22 04:34:59	+winny	like 15+ years
2018-09-22 04:35:01	+sircmpwn	the problem with real old is that they suck up a lot of power
2018-09-22 04:35:05	+sircmpwn	x200 is 11 years old fyi
2018-09-22 04:35:06	+winny	yeah it's true
2018-09-22 04:35:07	+winny	:s
2018-09-22 04:36:13	+LambdaComplex	sircmpwn: i'm pretty sure neovim's popularity is the reason that development of vim increased so noticeably starting in 2016 https://github.com/vim/vim/graphs/contributors
2018-09-22 04:36:24	+sircmpwn	entirely possible
2018-09-22 04:36:26	+brooks	correct take
2018-09-22 04:36:26	+LambdaComplex	and i'm also pretty sure neovim's async is the reason vim finally got async
2018-09-22 04:36:30	+sircmpwn	entirely possible
2018-09-22 04:36:32	+LambdaComplex	competition is good
2018-09-22 04:36:36	+sircmpwn	that embedded terminal is dumb though
2018-09-22 04:36:38	+brooks	this capitalist nonsense
2018-09-22 04:36:40	+sircmpwn	just ^z like a normal person
2018-09-22 04:36:47	+LambdaComplex	also kek @ starving african children
2018-09-22 04:37:04	+LambdaComplex	neovim still has :help uganda
2018-09-22 04:37:06	+LambdaComplex	if that's worth anything
2018-09-22 04:37:18	+winny	dude what is this fuckin shit
2018-09-22 04:37:21	+winny	dropped alpine 100%
2018-09-22 04:37:24	+winny	reeee

2018-09-22 04:37:50	+sircmpwn	fuck no it doesn't
2018-09-22 04:37:57	+winny	don't bother packaging it
2018-09-22 04:38:02	+winny	it's sort of awkward to package just right
2018-09-22 04:38:07	+sircmpwn	I'll grab the tarball and package it on my way to spain
2018-09-22 04:38:10	+sircmpwn	I've packaged nethack before

2018-09-22 04:59:35	+winny	what's a weird linux distro to look at
2018-09-22 04:59:46	+winny	i think i might install void linux for irony
2018-09-22 04:59:49	+winny	in a vm
2018-09-22 05:00:05	+brooks	I read that into the void post and got really excited about void
2018-09-22 05:00:08	+brooks	r i p
2018-09-22 05:00:19	+winny	lol
2018-09-22 05:00:26	+LambdaComplex	into the void is a decent song
2018-09-22 05:00:34	+winny	i booted up manjaro and realized it was pointless to actually install
2018-09-22 05:00:45	+winny	i thought the grub boot options were really dumb
2018-09-22 05:01:01	+winny	it offers grub menu options to set tz, language, and keyboard layout
2018-09-22 05:01:12	+winny	but no dvorak and America/Chicago was missing
2018-09-22 05:01:16	+winny	so lol
2018-09-22 05:01:22	+winny	3/10
2018-09-22 05:03:31	+winny	i guess swish gui distros are hard to get excited over because they're so user unfriendly anyway
2018-09-22 05:03:35	+winny	er rather, winny unfriendly

2018-09-22 13:17:18	+winny	really i just want to see what sort of design decisinos they made in making a new linux distro
2018-09-22 13:18:20	+winny	unrelated, me and my bud are doing a presentation with some hands on about web apis
2018-09-22 13:18:25	+winny	in particular REST
2018-09-22 13:18:28	+lvmbdv	void linux's package manager is p gud imo
2018-09-22 13:19:02	+winny	i just realized, maybe i should just write a simple server for a raspi (or something with gpio) that lets u control this RGB color strip we have
2018-09-22 13:22:31	+FreeFull	Void Linux fits on a 2GB USB stick better than Arch does

2018-09-22 13:24:24	+winny	i really didn't see much other than some better autoconfiguration and themeing, and an installer that is based off of what appears to be ubuntu's installer
2018-09-22 13:25:09	+winny	and a very overzealous boot-time configuration of locale/TZ/keymap (wtf no dvorak listed tho)

2018-09-22 16:20:41	+LambdaComplex	Mighty: what
2018-09-22 16:20:55	+LambdaComplex	Mighty: why are you asking that
2018-09-22 16:23:42	+FreeFull	Write a new initd in Rust
2018-09-22 16:25:34	+LambdaComplex	tfw i haven't contributed to redox
2018-09-22 16:26:29	+trinary	FreeFull - I did write a single-purpose init in Rust, and now I can't use it because I don't really understand how cargo does cross-compilation :/
2018-09-22 16:26:56	+trinary	The whole point of doing it in Rust was so that I could use more robust parsing than bash would do
2018-09-22 16:27:14	+LambdaComplex	so can we talk about Free Churro
2018-09-22 16:27:24	+trinary	About what?
2018-09-22 16:27:24	+LambdaComplex	aka the best bojack horseman episode ever
2018-09-22 16:28:08	+FreeFull	trinary: From what I've done with cross-compilation, adding a linker in cargo's config and using --target was enough
2018-09-22 16:28:14	+FreeFull	But maybe for your case you need something more?
2018-09-22 16:28:36	+trinary	FreeFull - Oh, yes, it works just fine when I use cargo
2018-09-22 16:29:42	+LambdaComplex	i need to rewatch that episode
2018-09-22 16:29:44	+FreeFull	trinary: Here's my ~/.cargo/config https://dpaste.de/OO7Q/raw
2018-09-22 16:30:16	+trinary	But using cargo with Nix means having to do a clean build every time, so I don't want to use cargo
2018-09-22 16:30:27	+FreeFull	Ah
2018-09-22 16:31:27	+trinary	I'm just not patient enough to wait 5 minutes for every change I make

2018-09-22 16:32:25	+winny	on rest apis
2018-09-22 16:33:19	+LambdaComplex	are rest apis the same thing as http apis
2018-09-22 16:33:22	+LambdaComplex	or is there a distinction
2018-09-22 16:33:23	+winny	yes basically
2018-09-22 16:33:25	+LambdaComplex	i still haven't figured that out
2018-09-22 16:33:35	+winny	rest is just a more specific/rigorous definition

2018-09-22 16:45:53	+lvmbdv	what is dailyprog.org Mighty 
2018-09-22 16:46:07	+lvmbdv	LambdaComplex: it's not C/C++
2018-09-22 16:46:20	+Mighty	it uses this lib i wrote myself as an exercise http://dailyprog.org/~mighty/IRCBot/
2018-09-22 16:46:32	+Mighty	blocking sockets though :(
2018-09-22 16:46:54	+Mighty	but good as long as you arent making a neural network with it

2018-09-22 16:47:05	+FreeFull	deduplicate*
2018-09-22 16:47:21	+Mighty	yeah i still need to restart the bot to make it parse those properly
2018-09-22 16:47:23	+FreeFull	lvmbdv: C and C++ are squeaky clean?
2018-09-22 16:47:26	+Mighty	its a pain in the ass
2018-09-22 16:47:38	+lvmbdv	maybe until C99 and C++11
2018-09-22 16:48:25	+Mighty	prolly have to read on good search algorithms so it doesnt shit itself checking the whole file for duplicates
2018-09-22 16:49:32	+FreeFull	I vastly prefer writing Rust over writing C or C++

2018-09-22 17:11:38	+LambdaComplex	what have you written in rust
2018-09-22 17:11:46	+brooks	although I'm actually slightly more inclined toward nim but I'm ignoring that 
2018-09-22 17:12:09	+brooks	nothing I think
2018-09-22 17:12:38	+brooks	some silly mathy example programs, some project euler maybe 
2018-09-22 17:12:48	+brooks	some rust book stuff
2018-09-22 17:13:12	+brooks	I was making headway earlier this year but I can't remember what I was writing 
2018-09-22 17:16:47	+brooks	I'm gonna start again because of this conversation thanks every1

2018-09-22 21:53:00	+LambdaComplex	congress controls them but they have no representation in congress

2018-09-22 21:53:22	+rocx	LambdaComplex: these people should be chanting "no taxation without representation".

2018-09-22 21:55:59	+naught0	>:)
2018-09-22 21:56:10	+LambdaComplex	there's an entire wikipedia page on their voting rights https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_voting_rights
2018-09-22 21:56:40	+LambdaComplex	naught0: are you saying you disagree with the ruling of DC v Heller?
2018-09-22 21:56:49	+naught0	mhmm
2018-09-22 21:56:56	+LambdaComplex	state your argument!
2018-09-22 21:57:11	 *	LambdaComplex reads the wikipedia page to make sure the ruling is what he remembers it was :^)
2018-09-22 21:57:31	+naught0	I have only just re-read about it since I'm takin a class about the scotus
2018-09-22 21:58:12	+naught0	I just think that stringent laws about guns, even when they're in the home, are a good thing
2018-09-22 21:58:52	+LambdaComplex	that's not really the issue at hand though; the case was about the constitutionality of the handgun laws in DC
2018-09-22 21:59:05	+naught0	which were about guns in the home iirc
2018-09-22 21:59:08	+LambdaComplex	yes
2018-09-22 21:59:19	+naught0	so that's the issue at had innit
2018-09-22 21:59:21	+LambdaComplex	but unconstitutional laws are unconstitutional
2018-09-22 21:59:23	+naught0	hand even
2018-09-22 21:59:29	+naught0	well in the interpretation it was
2018-09-22 21:59:32	+naught0	split decision
2018-09-22 22:01:04	+naught0	I want the gubbermint 2 take ur guns u hicks

2018-09-22 22:01:22	+rocx	i'd still like to have a plan B even if i don't care for plan Bs all that much
2018-09-22 22:02:12	+LambdaComplex	tbh i'll agree that the wording of the 2nd amendment is more vague than it should be
2018-09-22 22:02:22	+LambdaComplex	>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.[92]
2018-09-22 22:02:28	+LambdaComplex	sooooooooooo what's a Militia exactly
2018-09-22 22:02:33	+rocx	tl;dr "if britiain ever comes back, we'll be ready"
2018-09-22 22:02:44	+naught0	yeah so afaik it doesn't necessarily pertain to the individual right to "bear arms"
2018-09-22 22:02:51	+naught0	which was the primary disagreement 
2018-09-22 22:02:58	+LambdaComplex	naught0: right
2018-09-22 22:03:00	+LambdaComplex	but
2018-09-22 22:03:07	+LambdaComplex	> the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed
2018-09-22 22:03:07	+rocx	LambdaComplex: tl;dr a militia's an "army of trained civilians".
2018-09-22 22:03:11	+naught0	tl;dr fuck guns
2018-09-22 22:03:20	+rocx	an army reserve, possibly police, so on.
2018-09-22 22:03:21	+LambdaComplex	"the people" is also the language used in the 1st amendment
2018-09-22 22:03:27	+LambdaComplex	to apply to all citizens
2018-09-22 22:03:35	+LambdaComplex	it's also used in the 4th
2018-09-22 22:03:36	+naught0	during the framing, though, people were expected to be ready to defend against invasions etc
2018-09-22 22:03:37	+rocx	aka "free white folk, predominantly men" at the time.
2018-09-22 22:03:44	+LambdaComplex	....and the 9th
2018-09-22 22:03:46	+naught0	certain principalities would fine you if you weren't armed
2018-09-22 22:03:46	+LambdaComplex	and the 10th
2018-09-22 22:04:18	+LambdaComplex	so why would the phrase "the people" mean "all citizens" in every amendment except the 2nd?
2018-09-22 22:04:22	+LambdaComplex	my take: it wouldn't
2018-09-22 22:04:48	+rocx	my take: "whomever it may concern"
2018-09-22 22:05:04	+LambdaComplex	and who decides whom it concerns?
2018-09-22 22:05:06	+naught0	guns bad

2018-09-22 22:37:15	+brooks	they aren't even a similar end
2018-09-22 22:37:15	+rocx	naught0: to be fair, i've heard people compare communism as something without personal property then someone somewhere else explain something marx's difference between public, private, and personal property.
2018-09-22 22:37:32	+naught0	is the end result not supposed to be equality
2018-09-22 22:37:33	+brooks	communism is something without private property, not personal property
2018-09-22 22:37:36	+naught0	am I dum
2018-09-22 22:37:46	+naught0	I just want a gubbermint paycheck to sit on my ass
2018-09-22 22:37:46	+brooks	personal property is your toothbrush, private property is an apartment complex
2018-09-22 22:37:48	+rocx	brooks: it's common to assume private = personal.
2018-09-22 22:37:48	+naught0	is that so hard
2018-09-22 22:38:14	+rocx	brooks: would an apartment it self (where one lives rather than the building) be considered private in that sense?
2018-09-22 22:38:15	+brooks	naught0: welfare states aren't about equality
2018-09-22 22:38:20	+naught0	y not
2018-09-22 22:38:31	+brooks	they're about making sure everyone can participate in capitalism
2018-09-22 22:38:48	+naught0	I guess it's more to make sure you're not beaten to death by the capitalist machine
2018-09-22 22:38:53	+rocx	which is ironically about having fewer people participate.
2018-09-22 22:39:01	+naught0	I'd like to participate in u
2018-09-22 22:39:02	+naught0	:~)
2018-09-22 22:39:25	+brooks	socialism is "workers are in charge of their own work/labor"
2018-09-22 22:39:42	+brooks	if people are still working for a wage, that ain't socialism
2018-09-22 22:39:54	+rocx	what would people work for instead?
2018-09-22 22:40:04	+naught0	good feels
2018-09-22 22:40:19	+rocx	naught0: then there'd be no one taking it seriously.
2018-09-22 22:40:19	+brooks	under socialism, the profit of the enterprise I guess
2018-09-22 22:40:42	+brooks	i.e. literally everyone has a stake in the success of the enterprise, everyone is motivated for real because it's something personal
2018-09-22 22:40:59	+brooks	richard wolff has a pretty good video on this, but I don't agree with him entirely
2018-09-22 22:41:05	+brooks	here:
2018-09-22 22:41:08	+naught0	is he the super rich guy that has 0 place to talk about socialism
2018-09-22 22:41:16	+rocx	that's musk.
2018-09-22 22:41:21	+rocx	or jeff bozos.

2018-09-22 22:41:37	+naught0	perhaps billionaire
2018-09-22 22:41:51	+naught0	how can you take someone who's wealthy from the capitalist system seriously on topics of socialism
2018-09-22 22:41:55	+naught0	I know that sounds dumb but like
2018-09-22 22:42:22	+naught0	idk it seems disingenuous
2018-09-22 22:42:36	+rocx	naught0: sometimes it may be a way for someone to be able to pave their dream on top of what's already there.
2018-09-22 22:42:36	+brooks	if doesn't sound dumb, not exactly 
2018-09-22 22:42:42	+brooks	i*t

2018-09-22 22:43:00	+naught0	it's fake n' gay as the kids say
2018-09-22 22:43:22	+rocx	"fake and gay" went out of fashion yærs ago.
2018-09-22 22:43:27	+brooks	I'm not a socialist from a moral place exactly so I don't feel quite the same way 
2018-09-22 22:43:45	+brooks	but I can see it 
2018-09-22 22:44:31	+brooks	that video is 3 minutes and I rec it 
2018-09-22 22:46:53	+bdelloid	rocx, not really, still used
2018-09-22 22:46:56	+rocx	the one thing that i can see going wrong about a democratic system (in general) is it easily getting gamed like we see now.
2018-09-22 22:47:09	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-22 22:47:19	+brooks	socialism isn't the end game, it's the first stage of it
2018-09-22 22:47:28	+rocx	kind of makes me dubious about the solely "democaratic enterprise" he's talking about. eventually a popularity contest.
2018-09-22 22:47:51	+brooks	Marx admits socialism isn't far enough, but it beats what we have now 
2018-09-22 22:47:59	+rocx	kind of make sme wonder if that's much more of a reason trump got in. not for what he stands for, but because he's a familiar name especially if they watched `the apprentice'.
2018-09-22 22:48:18	+brooks	that's part of it, yes. Reagan did the same
2018-09-22 22:48:54	+brooks	communism is about removing/modifying the incentives at play so that none of this is necessary anymore
2018-09-22 22:50:14	+brooks	communism is the stage after socialism, if you don't know
2018-09-22 22:50:24	+rocx	i recall that before.
2018-09-22 22:50:33	+brooks	Wolff is acting like it's all that's necessary but that's. not right, but it's also fine 
2018-09-22 22:50:35	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-22 22:50:49	+brooks	that's it really
2018-09-22 22:51:20	+brooks	it's pretty straightforward, common sense type stuff. but it gets complicated because of history and various factions and groups calling themselves this or that
2018-09-22 22:51:38	+brooks	e.g. there's a reason people think socialism is big government 
2018-09-22 22:51:46	+rocx	...russia.
2018-09-22 22:51:53	+brooks	not just that 
2018-09-22 22:52:14	+brooks	1910s and 1020s Germany 
2018-09-22 22:52:16	+brooks	too
2018-09-22 22:52:19	+rocx	oh right the nazis.
2018-09-22 22:52:33	+brooks	that's a big part of jt
2018-09-22 22:52:37	+rocx	oh 1910s. then guess a bit before that too.
2018-09-22 22:52:59	+brooks	the nazis were able to do that because of the socialist party that was big at the time
2018-09-22 22:53:04	+brooks	and it too was fake socialists 
2018-09-22 22:53:26	+rocx	oooooh my i've heard way too much about how nazis = "left wing" just because of the name.
2018-09-22 22:53:47	+brooks	yeah I can call myself whatever I want, doesn't make me honest
2018-09-22 22:54:11	+brooks	this is hard to write out from a phone rip
2018-09-22 22:55:09	+brooks	but yeah it was illegal to write about anti government shit toward the end of Marx's days and so there was a faction of followers of Marx who were misunderstanding and/or twisting his stuff around to claim you could enter into the state and slowly push toward socialism
2018-09-22 22:55:47	+brooks	the crowd in the 1910s and 1920s were one such group, and they actually ousted the real communists/socialists from the party
2018-09-22 22:56:11	+brooks	this caused a ton of problems, not the least of which was it paved the way for the bazis
2018-09-22 22:56:13	+brooks	nazis
2018-09-22 22:56:49	+brooks	there's more to it than this too, some stuff happened in the 70s with the Soviet union that might also have contributed to this 
2018-09-22 22:56:58	+brooks	a good linguist could probably help me out
2018-09-22 22:57:18	+brooks	I myself am a trash linguist and only speak English
2018-09-22 22:57:26	+brooks	....sorta
2018-09-22 23:00:17	+brooks	if you want the real rundown though, here's what you need to know: economics as we understand it today is the study of the way exchange works in the economy. economics as it was understood by marx, and the classical economists, such as adam smith or david ricardo, understood it as the study of the economy as a whole, centering their study first and foremost on the relations of *production*. modern
2018-09-22 23:00:19	+brooks	economics takes production wholly for granted, and this makes it literally incapable of imagining anything other than capitalism
2018-09-22 23:00:45	+brooks	it can only conceive of alternatives to capitalism as imposing restrictions on exchange, as being anti-freedom
2018-09-22 23:01:07	+brooks	and this understanding of economics has been normalized, most people think this way now

2018-09-22 23:35:33	+LambdaComplex	timecube is totally the result of socialism
2018-09-22 23:35:34	+brooks	ehhhhh kinda, yes and no, etc etc etc
2018-09-22 23:36:42	+brooks	marx & engels put forth 'scientific socialism', which has become the dominant form of it, in contrast to what was dubbed (by them) 'utopian socialism', which had already become popular by the time they came along (and possibly before they were born, not sure)
2018-09-22 23:37:23	+brooks	so socialism today pretty much always refers to either marx's & engels's formulations or to libertarian socialist formulations
2018-09-22 23:37:59	+brooks	some might characterize them as having the goal of equality, but I still wouldn't, mostly because I think it makes for a bad argument/formulation and I'm a massive nerd

2018-09-22 23:44:37	+rocx	naught0: no, 📦 is a box.
2018-09-22 23:44:44	+naught0	they are both equally boxes
2018-09-22 23:45:11	+rocx	then you need to fix your fonts. 😿
2018-09-22 23:45:22	+brooks	fuuuuck I traded the gun with the silencer without noticing
2018-09-22 23:45:36	+rocx	brooks: game?
2018-09-22 23:45:44	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-22 23:45:50	+rocx	as in what game?
2018-09-22 23:45:53	+brooks	oh
2018-09-22 23:46:00	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava brooks are you still listening to mammal sauce
2018-09-22 23:46:01	+rocx	my bad for not being specific.

2018-09-22 23:46:11	+LambdaComplex	what
2018-09-22 23:46:14	+rocx	lol people are still playing that one?
2018-09-22 23:46:20	+brooks	no just me
2018-09-22 23:46:27	+Kirjava	LambdaComplex: no I turned it off eventually people are sleeping ._.
2018-09-22 23:46:57	+brooks	it's my first time playing it
2018-09-22 23:47:06	+brooks	afaik there are only two silencers in the game and I was only able to get one of them
2018-09-22 23:47:07	+naught0	turned on unifont fallback and they are both boxes still >:(
2018-09-22 23:47:07	+brooks	and now it's fone
2018-09-22 23:47:10	+brooks	r i p
2018-09-22 23:47:12	+naught0	I got epig troll'd
2018-09-22 23:47:26	+isk	<trinary> isk - That looks kinda broken, but that may be my font
2018-09-22 23:47:27	+brooks	LambdaComplex: I haven't listened to it yet
2018-09-22 23:47:29	+isk	it's the font on the website
2018-09-22 23:47:37	+isk	just download and g++ yourself
2018-09-22 23:47:52	+isk	I just put it on the website to show it wasn't malware
2018-09-22 23:48:43	+isk	anyone who's curious: https://www.onlinegdb.com/r1cBdPQY7
2018-09-22 23:48:59	+isk	made a smooth stochastic gradient generator implemented with a linked list
2018-09-22 23:50:08	+naught0	whoah
2018-09-22 23:50:11	+naught0	trippy bro
2018-09-22 23:50:26	+isk	it's a proof-of-concept before I implement it on my room lights
2018-09-22 23:50:41	+isk	each block represents the brightness of an LED
2018-09-22 23:50:59	+isk	now just need to make it so each node is a distinct color and the gradients change between them
2018-09-22 23:51:49	+Kirjava	heh. always like this stuff you make isk 
2018-09-22 23:52:24	+isk	thanks
2018-09-22 23:52:40	+isk	It still gets a floating point except about 1/10 invokations
2018-09-22 23:53:00	+naught0	I wanna run it in my terminal
2018-09-22 23:53:02	+isk	not sure what's causing that but I suspect it's when the head of the linked list is at position 0
2018-09-22 23:53:06	+naught0	and watch the pretty colors
2018-09-22 23:53:09	+Kirjava	cant u make line 17 less long :////
2018-09-22 23:53:09	+isk	naught0: just wget to cpp and g++
2018-09-22 23:53:24	+isk	yes Kirjava but it's just a glorified switchcase
2018-09-22 23:53:35	+isk	all it does is convert x/255 to one of the unicode 1/8 blocks
2018-09-22 23:53:47	+isk	if you have a faster way of doing that let me know
2018-09-22 23:54:01	+Kirjava	faster? I'm just talking about more readable
2018-09-22 23:54:14	+isk	e.g. return '\u' + (2581 + x/255 * 8)
2018-09-22 23:54:17	+isk	but that doesn't work
2018-09-22 23:54:31	+isk	er x*8 / 255
2018-09-22 23:54:32	+naught0	is there a /raw I can throw in the url somewhere 
2018-09-22 23:54:34	+naught0	:o
2018-09-22 23:54:36	+LambdaComplex	hey isk why don't you rewrite this in rust

2018-09-22 23:56:13	+isk	it's not an issue with the font
2018-09-22 23:56:18	+naught0	oh?
2018-09-22 23:56:27	+brooks	what's the issue 
2018-09-22 23:56:35	+naught0	is it my inherent gayness
2018-09-22 23:56:37	+isk	I mean I'm no expert
2018-09-22 23:56:37	+naught0	:(
2018-09-22 23:56:42	+brooks	I haven't figured out why my new install has boxes get 
2018-09-22 23:56:43	+brooks	yet
2018-09-22 23:56:46	+isk	but I'm pretty sure fonts pull from a common "emoticon font"

2018-09-22 23:57:05	+isk	or tey can choose to impliement the emoticons themselves
2018-09-22 23:57:29	+isk	but I'm guessing you don't have a default expanded{tm} emoticon pack
2018-09-22 23:57:33	+naught0	ah this is so cool in terminal

2018-09-22 23:57:39	+isk	yeah
2018-09-22 23:57:48	+brooks	I think my terminal has fontconfig support 
2018-09-22 23:57:50	+isk	especially if your terminal supports 8-bit color
2018-09-22 23:57:56	+naught0	I should ditch urxvt probably :<
2018-09-22 23:57:56	+brooks	it should be using the fallback
2018-09-22 23:58:04	+brooks	for what tbh
2018-09-22 23:58:12	+naught0	termite? st? something?
2018-09-22 23:58:15	+brooks	termite is the only decent alt and its bad 
2018-09-22 23:58:18	+naught0	oh
2018-09-22 23:58:34	+naught0	excuse me isk but I terminated the program and it's still flashing @ me
2018-09-22 23:58:44	+naught0	what is this magic
2018-09-22 23:58:47	+isk	?
2018-09-22 23:58:49	+naught0	sec
2018-09-22 23:58:55	+brooks	it requires a fork of vte that lags behind and vte is a libvirt dependency, so it breaks my VMs
2018-09-22 23:59:00	+isk	ctrl+c kills it fine for me
2018-09-22 23:59:02	+brooks	I miss termite 
2018-09-22 23:59:32	+brooks	I wish he maintained it as a patch or something 
2018-09-23 00:01:40	+naught0	solution: never use another VM again ever
2018-09-23 00:01:42	+naught0	yw
2018-09-23 00:01:55	+brooks	thanks
2018-09-23 00:02:01	+naught0	I'm here to please

2018-09-23 00:05:06	+isk	this version shows you the respective position of the nodes that exist in the linked list
2018-09-23 00:05:10	+isk	as white blocks
2018-09-23 00:05:17	+brooks	update: I just looked at it wrong, I still have the one with the silencer, but also there are a few more to be found
2018-09-23 00:05:49	+naught0	oh man this one is more intense
2018-09-23 00:06:18	+isk	changes color everytime you run it
2018-09-23 00:06:45	+isk	but yeah the white blocks are the only "stored" memory
2018-09-23 00:06:50	+naught0	I like it
2018-09-23 00:06:53	+naught0	it's comfy
2018-09-23 00:06:54	+isk	everything else is computed per frame
2018-09-23 00:07:05	+isk	because I needed to conserve memory for the implementation
2018-09-23 00:07:10	+naught0	jumps my cpu usage by like 25%
2018-09-23 00:07:11	+naught0	lul
2018-09-23 00:07:16	+isk	well
2018-09-23 00:07:27	+isk	most of that is nopt's from waiting 1ms per frame
2018-09-23 00:07:33	+naught0	fastboye
2018-09-23 00:08:50	+isk	at least it doesn't leak memory :)
2018-09-23 00:09:07	+naught0	that'd be too much fun
2018-09-23 00:09:47	+isk	well I changed the implementation so I only create heap nodes if the insert location is valie
2018-09-23 00:09:49	+isk	valid
2018-09-23 00:09:57	+isk	before I created them by default 
2018-09-23 00:10:03	+isk	and deleted if the position was invalid
2018-09-23 00:10:16	+isk	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-09-23 00:10:33	+isk	now you can make animation riced screenshots

2018-09-23 00:47:14	+LambdaComplex	w-what implications
2018-09-23 00:47:32	+brooks	the terminal shouldn't have mouse support, because it's not 1970s enough already
2018-09-23 00:47:58	+LambdaComplex	oh, of course!
2018-09-23 00:48:00	+LambdaComplex	silly me

2018-09-23 00:49:20	+brooks	wait do you mean the thing where you click and drag and it changes buffers
2018-09-23 00:49:32	+brooks	I have mouse support disabled *in weechat* because of shit like that
2018-09-23 00:49:39	+brooks	it also likes to magically turn itself on and break shit

2018-09-23 00:52:20	+LambdaComplex	HMMMM
2018-09-23 00:52:27	+LambdaComplex	(the answer is "none, because sitcoms are trash")
2018-09-23 00:52:58	+naught0	only true intellectuals can appreciate the artform of the sitcom
2018-09-23 00:53:00	+naught0	like the big bang theory
2018-09-23 00:53:10	+brooks	sitcoms are bad and antisitcoms are still sitcoms
2018-09-23 00:53:18	+brooks	thus rick and morty and bojack horseman are also bad
2018-09-23 00:53:25	+naught0	sorry bojack is great
2018-09-23 00:53:29	+brooks	bojack is okay
2018-09-23 00:53:34	+naught0	sorry bojack is great
2018-09-23 00:53:36	+brooks	R&M is ok (bojack is better)
2018-09-23 00:53:42	+naught0	great
2018-09-23 00:53:43	+brooks	but sitcom format bad
2018-09-23 00:54:01	+naught0	I mean
2018-09-23 00:54:07	+brooks	but the best sitcom is that 70s show, which is about economic anxiety and class struggle
2018-09-23 00:54:12	+naught0	what
2018-09-23 00:54:23	+naught0	that show is tolerable
2018-09-23 00:54:38	+brooks	you gotta pay more attention!
2018-09-23 00:55:25	+naught0	shrug
2018-09-23 00:55:26	+brooks	it's the collapse of the economy, the anxiety after watergate (the lack of mention of COINTELPRO not being a coincidence), hyde's anti-government and anti-authority musings, red's attempts to be a Good Man while the system fails him
2018-09-23 00:55:37	+darkwater	i would recommend the big bang theory but you may not have enough iq points to understand the humor
2018-09-23 00:55:56	+brooks	bob, the fucking moron who was in the national guard, being rewarded for incompetence AND being a total asshole
2018-09-23 00:55:58	+naught0	brooks: idk if that was intended
2018-09-23 00:56:03	+brooks	that 70s show is high art
2018-09-23 00:56:08	+naught0	I can't tell if satire
2018-09-23 00:56:12	+darkwater	oh are we back to politics
2018-09-23 00:56:16	+naught0	they're all token american tropes
2018-09-23 00:56:35	+naught0	darkwater: ur a politic
2018-09-23 00:56:37	+darkwater	capitalism sucks but so does communism, invent something new
2018-09-23 00:56:39	+naught0	confirm/deny
2018-09-23 00:56:51	+darkwater	thats my stance on politics
2018-09-23 00:56:57	+brooks	communism is too basic to suck
2018-09-23 00:57:11	+darkwater	are you literally putin
2018-09-23 00:57:19	+brooks	putin is a capitalist

2018-09-23 00:58:18	+naught0	such a huge mistake
2018-09-23 00:58:21	+darkwater	now you have to run 324908254 miles
2018-09-23 00:58:23	+brooks	anyway, yeah this stuff was "intended", it was designed around these tropes and this backdrop
2018-09-23 00:58:25	+naught0	my tum's a sadboi
2018-09-23 00:58:34	+brooks	but it's not a major part of the show
2018-09-23 00:58:35	+naught0	brooks: proof
2018-09-23 00:58:41	+brooks	it's just how I enjoyed it
2018-09-23 00:59:22	+brooks	red loses his job early on because the factory moves out, there's a lot of friction between him and eric because red wants eric to be a Good Man according to the american ideals red can't shake
2018-09-23 00:59:32	+brooks	but eric doesn't really buy into that shit, nor do any of his friends
2018-09-23 00:59:52	+brooks	and then these points of friction are occasionally eased or resolved with explicitly political episodes where red can't help but respect eric
2018-09-23 00:59:56	+LambdaComplex	bojack is great
2018-09-23 00:59:57	+brooks	it's not even subtext, it's actual text
2018-09-23 00:59:58	+naught0	tfw can't self-induce vomitting :(
2018-09-23 01:00:04	+LambdaComplex	brooks: how far did you even get in bojack
2018-09-23 01:00:06	+brooks	that's my proof
2018-09-23 01:00:08	+naught0	ok but consider this:
2018-09-23 01:00:10	+naught0	ur a subtext
2018-09-23 01:00:12	+naught0	>:(
2018-09-23 01:00:16	+brooks	LambdaComplex: I didn't finish the first season
2018-09-23 01:00:19	+naught0	wtf brooks 
2018-09-23 01:00:21	+brooks	maybe 8 episodes
2018-09-23 01:00:25	+LambdaComplex	ugggggh
2018-09-23 01:00:27	+naught0	it doesn't come into its own until after that point
2018-09-23 01:00:32	+LambdaComplex	brooks: everyone knows the start of the first season is the worst part
2018-09-23 01:00:36	+brooks	bojack horseman is depressing and bojack the character is totally unsympathetic
2018-09-23 01:00:39	+naught0	the first few bits were highly lackluster
2018-09-23 01:00:42	+LambdaComplex	^
2018-09-23 01:00:47	+brooks	I didn't know that, I watch more tv than literally all of my friends
2018-09-23 01:00:48	+LambdaComplex	go finish the first season
2018-09-23 01:00:52	+brooks	so I had no one to talk to about it ;_;
2018-09-23 01:00:55	+brooks	kk
2018-09-23 01:00:57	+brooks	on it
2018-09-23 01:00:58	+LambdaComplex	:D
2018-09-23 01:00:59	+LambdaComplex	right now??
2018-09-23 01:01:01	+naught0	it's super duper good
2018-09-23 01:01:03	+LambdaComplex	^
2018-09-23 01:01:04	+naught0	I may or may not have cried
2018-09-23 01:01:07	+brooks	yeah I'm gonna go download it
2018-09-23 01:01:12	+LambdaComplex	naught0: have you watched season 5
2018-09-23 01:01:17	+naught0	not yet :o
2018-09-23 01:01:19	+LambdaComplex	!!!!!!!
2018-09-23 01:01:27	+LambdaComplex	naught0: did you like the underwater episode
2018-09-23 01:01:27	+naught0	I'm too focused on my foodbaby rn
2018-09-23 01:01:35	+naught0	I hated it at first and then after I was like "FUCK"
2018-09-23 01:01:44	+LambdaComplex	they did something even crazier than that one
2018-09-23 01:01:47	+naught0	o no
2018-09-23 01:01:52	+LambdaComplex	c-can i tell you the premise
2018-09-23 01:02:25	+naught0	don't you dare
2018-09-23 01:02:27	+naught0	(yeah sure)
2018-09-23 01:02:50	+LambdaComplex	naught0: the entire episode is bojack monologuing
2018-09-23 01:02:54	+LambdaComplex	all 20whatever minutes of it
2018-09-23 01:03:04	+LambdaComplex	just will arnett talking and talking and talking
2018-09-23 01:03:06	+LambdaComplex	and it's beautiful
2018-09-23 01:03:09	+naught0	I love arnett :')
2018-09-23 01:03:15	+naught0	he's the only ninja turtle I need
2018-09-23 01:03:26	+naught0	you like arrested development then I take it?
2018-09-23 01:03:36	+LambdaComplex	never seen it
2018-09-23 01:03:38	+naught0	gasp
2018-09-23 01:03:47	+naught0	you have to watch it all the way through like twice to fully appreciate it
2018-09-23 01:04:37	+LambdaComplex	like primer??
2018-09-23 01:04:38	+naught0	so it really didn't lend itself to network televsion airing every week or so
2018-09-23 01:04:41	+naught0	fuck primer tbh
2018-09-23 01:04:45	+LambdaComplex	what
2018-09-23 01:04:47	+naught0	it's like that but dumbed the fuck down
2018-09-23 01:04:48	+LambdaComplex	primer is good
2018-09-23 01:04:53	+LambdaComplex	what's wrong with primer
2018-09-23 01:04:54	+naught0	don't be pretentious
2018-09-23 01:05:01	+naught0	it made no sense and you know it
2018-09-23 01:05:13	+LambdaComplex	yes it does! you just need a really complicated chart to follow it
2018-09-23 01:05:23	+naught0	yeah why would I want to do that
2018-09-23 01:05:26	+brooks	primer didn't need to make sense
2018-09-23 01:05:29	+LambdaComplex	but it does
2018-09-23 01:05:32	+naught0	it was a clusterfuck
2018-09-23 01:05:33	+brooks	it was dudes standing around having realistic conversations
2018-09-23 01:05:39	+brooks	where people talked over each other
2018-09-23 01:05:41	+brooks	and shit
2018-09-23 01:05:43	+LambdaComplex	protip: the first time you see the machine work, aaron has already traveled back in time once
2018-09-23 01:05:44	+naught0	their science talk was annoying af
2018-09-23 01:05:59	+brooks	it was the first movie I saw that made me realize most every other movie got basic conversations wrong
2018-09-23 01:06:05	+LambdaComplex	brooks++
2018-09-23 01:06:23	+LambdaComplex	s/basic conversations/literally everything/
2018-09-23 01:06:24	+naught0	"If we reverse the singular polarity of the time solar flux we can reverse-engineer the backdoor algorithm and create a space warp in spacetime"
2018-09-23 01:06:24	+LambdaComplex	t b h
2018-09-23 01:06:28	+LambdaComplex	nothing is realistic
2018-09-23 01:06:31	+LambdaComplex	not even the colors
2018-09-23 01:06:34	+LambdaComplex	(especially not the colors)
2018-09-23 01:06:37	+LambdaComplex	pisses me off
2018-09-23 01:06:51	+LambdaComplex	i think the early seasons of The Office are the only tv i've seen that was actually realistic
2018-09-23 01:06:54	+brooks	that was just a doctor who reference
2018-09-23 01:07:05	+LambdaComplex	thanks tom
2018-09-23 01:07:06	+brooks	also yeah I rewatched with the chart and it made sense fine
2018-09-23 01:07:17	+brooks	how did you know my name is tom
2018-09-23 01:07:20	+brooks	no doxxing please
2018-09-23 01:07:24	+naught0	D:

2018-09-23 01:07:30	+brooks	(I'm joking)
2018-09-23 01:07:34	+naught0	:D
2018-09-23 01:07:37	+brooks	>http
2018-09-23 01:07:48	+naught0	good fontsize
2018-09-23 01:08:07	+brooks	https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/
2018-09-23 01:08:20	+naught0	how does that 's' make you feel safer
2018-09-23 01:08:22	+brooks	can someone who's played stalker tell me where the fuck max is
2018-09-23 01:08:25	+naught0	the goverment can see it all
2018-09-23 01:08:31	+LambdaComplex	wait, i got the names mixed up i think
2018-09-23 01:08:36	+naught0	gg no re
2018-09-23 01:08:37	+LambdaComplex	abe is the one who goes back first
2018-09-23 01:08:42	+brooks	naught0: my ISP can't just keep a log of literally everything I see
2018-09-23 01:08:48	+naught0	I've revoked your 'tru-fan' status sry LambdaComplex 
2018-09-23 01:08:49	+brooks	beats nothing
2018-09-23 01:08:59	+naught0	is that what https does
2018-09-23 01:09:03	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-23 01:09:11	+brooks	it prevents man in the middle attacks and eavesdropping
2018-09-23 01:09:12	+LambdaComplex	basically what makes primer good is that it does not hold your hand
2018-09-23 01:09:14	+LambdaComplex	at all
2018-09-23 01:09:16	+LambdaComplex	it's great
2018-09-23 01:09:29	+brooks	it also makes time travel something really basic, which I thought was fucking sick
2018-09-23 01:09:31	+brooks	like
2018-09-23 01:09:35	+naught0	m a g n e t s
2018-09-23 01:09:43	+naught0	nobody knows how they work, man
2018-09-23 01:09:45	+brooks	you always see time machines as some top tier genius shit
2018-09-23 01:09:46	+naught0	it's genius
2018-09-23 01:09:57	+brooks	but in this case they just fuck around and get it by luck
2018-09-23 01:10:00	+brooks	it was a nice change
2018-09-23 01:10:04	+brooks	v. refreshing
2018-09-23 01:10:21	+naught0	you know what I don't like
2018-09-23 01:10:26	+naught0	the "good" movies from the 80s
2018-09-23 01:10:36	+naught0	like breakfast club and back to the future
2018-09-23 01:10:43	+brooks	mostly same yeah
2018-09-23 01:11:00	+brooks	I liked the breakfast club the first time I saw it, but I rewatched how I met your mother
2018-09-23 01:11:15	+brooks	and they had a gag where they were going to dress up as the breakfast club characters
2018-09-23 01:11:23	+brooks	but they all dressed up as the "cool" one
2018-09-23 01:11:29	+brooks	and something about that bugged me
2018-09-23 01:11:31	+LambdaComplex	dae remember the xplay breakfast club episode
2018-09-23 01:11:32	+brooks	so I thought about it
2018-09-23 01:11:39	+brooks	I think it took me a year or so?
2018-09-23 01:11:41	+brooks	or maybe more idk
2018-09-23 01:11:47	+brooks	but I've figured out what bothers me
2018-09-23 01:12:01	+naught0	do tell
2018-09-23 01:12:10	+brooks	we were raised watching movies with people like we grew up to be, but we thought throughout the decades those movies were popular in, those kinds of people were hated
2018-09-23 01:12:12	+brooks	but they weren't
2018-09-23 01:12:14	+brooks	they were loved
2018-09-23 01:12:18	+brooks	and they still are
2018-09-23 01:12:21	+brooks	and we're emulating them now
2018-09-23 01:12:25	+brooks	and that freaks me the fuck out
2018-09-23 01:12:40	+brooks	and why are all the other characters less memorable and interesting
2018-09-23 01:12:56	+brooks	they were there to learn the lessons he had to teach them, it's weird
2018-09-23 01:13:11	+brooks	heathers is like this too, it's literally a revenge fantasy for the weird kids, that we grew up to be
2018-09-23 01:13:18	+naught0	heathers was good tho
2018-09-23 01:13:27	+naught0	first time through I didn't understand it was satire
2018-09-23 01:13:41	+naught0	not sure if it is satire
2018-09-23 01:13:42	+brooks	yeah, that's one of the reasons it holds up
2018-09-23 01:13:44	+brooks	it is
2018-09-23 01:13:46	+naught0	ok great
2018-09-23 01:13:50	+naught0	that made it much more enjoyable lol
2018-09-23 01:13:58	<--	naniwa (uid311599@I.want.to.because.you.think.I.cant) has quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
2018-09-23 01:14:01	+brooks	then there's that fucking band
2018-09-23 01:14:04	+brooks	the veronicas
2018-09-23 01:14:13	+brooks	I'm really tripped out by media and bojack
2018-09-23 01:14:14	+brooks	is the same trend
2018-09-23 01:14:16	+brooks	so is R&M
2018-09-23 01:14:18	+brooks	it freaks me out
2018-09-23 01:14:23	+naught0	the self-awareness ?
2018-09-23 01:14:34	+brooks	the illusion of self-awareness
2018-09-23 01:14:51	+naught0	I mean you can call anything an illusion
2018-09-23 01:14:53	+brooks	it's "aware" but it being "aware" doesn't change the paradigm, it's stuck in a loop
2018-09-23 01:15:03	+LambdaComplex	tfw i'm not reading that primer timeline
2018-09-23 01:15:05	+LambdaComplex	wew

2018-09-23 01:15:22	+brooks	it's got no solution to offer other than "at least I know I actually suck"
2018-09-23 01:15:40	+brooks	this isn't a criticism of bojack
2018-09-23 01:15:46	+brooks	it's a criticism of a paradigm of media
2018-09-23 01:15:48	+LambdaComplex	okay wait
2018-09-23 01:15:51	+brooks	and bojack happens to be in it
2018-09-23 01:15:55	+LambdaComplex	i was right the first time?
2018-09-23 01:15:58	+LambdaComplex	about abe/aaron
2018-09-23 01:15:59	+brooks	this doesn't make all of that media bad but yeah
2018-09-23 01:16:10	+LambdaComplex	no wait
2018-09-23 01:16:12	+LambdaComplex	abe went back first

2018-09-23 01:16:20	+LambdaComplex	pls
2018-09-23 01:16:21	 *	naught0 revokes it again
2018-09-23 01:16:38	+naught0	brooks: idk man I think they're pretty self-aware
2018-09-23 01:16:50	+naught0	to call it illusory is too philisophical imo
2018-09-23 01:16:53	+brooks	anyway yeah I'm not calling it an illusion in some shallow "critical" sense
2018-09-23 01:16:59	+naught0	you're getting too meta on the meta
2018-09-23 01:17:04	+brooks	I'm calling it an illusion to point to what I think is a deeper problem
2018-09-23 01:17:13	+naught0	problem? with media? gasp
2018-09-23 01:17:16	+naught0	:3
2018-09-23 01:17:19	+brooks	pls
2018-09-23 01:17:28	+naught0	sorry what is the problem then
2018-09-23 01:17:32	+naught0	I am invested
2018-09-23 01:17:49	+naught0	and how does it make media "bad"
2018-09-23 01:17:49	+LambdaComplex	also, reminder that primer's budget was $7000
2018-09-23 01:18:14	+naught0	reminder that primer is for dilettantes and pseudo-intellectuals
2018-09-23 01:18:15	+naught0	>:)
2018-09-23 01:18:20	+brooks	it doesn't make media bad
2018-09-23 01:18:25	+brooks	that's my point
2018-09-23 01:18:26	+brooks	like
2018-09-23 01:18:30	+brooks	well it's half my point
2018-09-23 01:18:33	+LambdaComplex	>uses the word dilettantes
2018-09-23 01:18:38	+LambdaComplex	>complains about pseudo-intellectuals
2018-09-23 01:18:44	+naught0	it was ironic
2018-09-23 01:18:48	+brooks	you can't just say "actually, everything is terrible" and call that critique or criticism
2018-09-23 01:18:57	+LambdaComplex	brooks: but you can call it accurate! :^)
2018-09-23 01:18:57	+brooks	that's not what I'm doin'
2018-09-23 01:18:58	+naught0	I think they're a bit more nuanced than that
2018-09-23 01:19:12	+LambdaComplex	hey brooks 
2018-09-23 01:19:15	+LambdaComplex	i have an important question
2018-09-23 01:19:17	+brooks	bojack is trapped in a paradigm that prevents it from actually resolving the anxieties it aggravates
2018-09-23 01:19:19	+naught0	I don't think they're flat-out criticisms of the world/media tho
2018-09-23 01:19:19	+LambdaComplex	about bojack horseman s1e2
2018-09-23 01:19:23	+brooks	so is the breakfast club
2018-09-23 01:19:36	+LambdaComplex	brooks: did neal mcbeal have dibs?
2018-09-23 01:19:41	+naught0	LOL
2018-09-23 01:19:47	+naught0	that motherfucker did not have dibs
2018-09-23 01:19:52	+brooks	I honestly don't remember what that refers to but I'll check it out in a little bit
2018-09-23 01:20:01	+LambdaComplex	IT'S THE PLOT OF AN ENTIRE EPISODE
2018-09-23 01:20:09	+LambdaComplex	god dammit
2018-09-23 01:20:12	+brooks	wait
2018-09-23 01:20:13	 *	LambdaComplex steals brooks' muffins
2018-09-23 01:20:15	+brooks	oh ok
2018-09-23 01:20:32	+LambdaComplex	20:15 <+naught0> that motherfucker did not have dibs
2018-09-23 01:20:36	+LambdaComplex	someone tattoo this on me
2018-09-23 01:20:41	+LambdaComplex	QFT
2018-09-23 01:20:42	+naught0	with my name in it preferably
2018-09-23 01:20:45	+brooks	I don't think he had dibs no
2018-09-23 01:20:50	+brooks	from what I remember
2018-09-23 01:20:51	+brooks	didn't he like
2018-09-23 01:20:55	+brooks	go to the bathroom or some shit
2018-09-23 01:20:57	+brooks	and come back and get mad
2018-09-23 01:20:58	+LambdaComplex	yes
2018-09-23 01:21:02	+naught0	I mean, what was he supposed to do tho
2018-09-23 01:21:06	+naught0	take the muffins with him?
2018-09-23 01:21:08	+brooks	yeah fuck him and his muffins
2018-09-23 01:21:18	+naught0	tfw that's the most thought-provoking message in the entire show
2018-09-23 01:21:20	+naught0	and it's about dibs
2018-09-23 01:21:32	+LambdaComplex	naught0: he should've left the muffins in a cart
2018-09-23 01:21:39	+LambdaComplex	then he would've obviously had dibs
2018-09-23 01:21:43	+brooks	no he was supposed to go home mildly upset about the muffins and not get on national tv and call out a washed up 90s sitcom character for dissing him
2018-09-23 01:21:44	+LambdaComplex	because it would've been in a cart
2018-09-23 01:21:45	+naught0	that's true
2018-09-23 01:21:52	+naught0	hmmm
2018-09-23 01:21:53	+LambdaComplex	brooks: that too
2018-09-23 01:21:54	+brooks	but bojack escalated it anyway
2018-09-23 01:22:04	+naught0	classic bojay

2018-09-23 01:24:16	+LambdaComplex	hi brooks i have all 3 STALKER games
2018-09-23 01:24:20	+LambdaComplex	i've hardly played any of them :^)
2018-09-23 01:24:26	+brooks	im currently the kid who played portal several years late and won't stop meming about it
2018-09-23 01:24:43	+naught0	all orange box games give me nausea :(
2018-09-23 01:24:47	 *	LambdaComplex slaps handcuffs on brooks

2018-09-23 01:24:56	+naught0	I like where this is going
2018-09-23 01:24:59	+naught0	oh
2018-09-23 01:25:03	+naught0	nevermind :(
2018-09-23 01:25:13	+brooks	LambdaComplex: you should listen to the adam curtis episode of chapo trap house and replay the first one
2018-09-23 01:25:14	+LambdaComplex	naught0: ask Kirjava to handcuff you
2018-09-23 01:25:22	+naught0	i dunnnnoooo
2018-09-23 01:25:25	+LambdaComplex	brooks: the first portal?
2018-09-23 01:25:34	+brooks	no the first STALKER
2018-09-23 01:25:40	+LambdaComplex	>replay
2018-09-23 01:25:42	+LambdaComplex	lol
2018-09-23 01:25:43	+LambdaComplex	it'd just be "play"
2018-09-23 01:25:46	+LambdaComplex	tbh
2018-09-23 01:25:51	+brooks	try it again, fine!!!
2018-09-23 01:25:57	+naught0	!!!!!!
2018-09-23 01:26:20	+brooks	what im saying is this is the peak of gaming and im done with games now
2018-09-23 01:26:26	+naught0	nice
2018-09-23 01:26:30	+LambdaComplex	have you played narbacular drop??
2018-09-23 01:26:42	+brooks	don't care, we live in the zone
2018-09-23 01:27:08	+LambdaComplex	narbacular drop was the final project of the 2005(?) seniors at the digipen institute of technology
2018-09-23 01:27:15	+LambdaComplex	the people that made it got hired by valve 
2018-09-23 01:27:17	+LambdaComplex	and then they made portal
2018-09-23 01:27:49	+rocx	then they left.
2018-09-23 01:27:53	+LambdaComplex	wait
2018-09-23 01:27:53	+naught0	u ever played nitronic rush tho
2018-09-23 01:27:55	+LambdaComplex	really?????
2018-09-23 01:28:03	+rocx	LambdaComplex: far as i recall.
2018-09-23 01:28:12	+rocx	maybe not as soon as portal was done.
2018-09-23 01:28:18	+LambdaComplex	>In December 2009, Swift left Valve to join Airtight Games.

2018-09-23 01:28:46	+rocx	what does valve really do anyway besides maintaining a DRM-store platform?
2018-09-23 01:28:57	+brooks	they're saving linux
2018-09-23 01:29:05	+naught0	RIP Linus
2018-09-23 01:29:07	+LambdaComplex	rocx: i think jeep still works at valve
2018-09-23 01:29:09	+rocx	oh right forgot that.
2018-09-23 01:29:19	+naught0	gosh darn feminazi sjws ruining my kernel!!!!!

2018-09-23 01:29:43	+LambdaComplex	make a card game?
2018-09-23 01:29:47	+rocx	besides that.
2018-09-23 01:29:50	+brooks	I unironically loved that post btw

2018-09-23 01:29:57	+LambdaComplex	and paint guns
2018-09-23 01:30:08	+brooks	that being said, I'm concerned it actually was more coerced than I wanted
2018-09-23 01:30:23	+naught0	some people really have a problem with the "don't be a dick" model of CoCs
2018-09-23 01:30:24	+rocx	brooks: he probably realized that he's probably driving away potent devs from the kernel.
2018-09-23 01:30:36	+LambdaComplex	hey bdelloid tell me how you feel about CoCs

2018-09-23 01:31:05	+brooks	I have a problem with the "don't be a dick" model of CoCs!
2018-09-23 01:31:14	+brooks	don't be a dick presumes everyone shares norms on what not being a dick entails!
2018-09-23 01:31:19	+naught0	blah blah
2018-09-23 01:31:32	+naught0	As the old saying goes
2018-09-23 01:31:38	+naught0	I can't define a dick but I know one when I see one
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+brooks	the point of CoCs is to create a shared space where this stuff can be hashed out
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+brooks	with basic respect
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+brooks	I support 'em
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+brooks	that's the thing
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+brooks	there are two sides to that
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+naught0	communities create norms and then you abide by them
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+naught0	shit evolves
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+brooks	yeah, but those communities are created largely by cishet white males etc etc
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+naught0	true
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+naught0	I haven't delved into the drama too much
2018-09-23 01:33:06	+brooks	you have to have some kind of method for facilitating other people participating
2018-09-23 01:34:22	+brooks	I haven't either
2018-09-23 01:34:28	+brooks	I was just thinking about the rust CoC
2018-09-23 01:35:10	+brooks	I just think you need more of a policy than "be nice to each other and extend basic respect" because what that entails isn't universal, and a given development community is likely to have norms that run against those goals
2018-09-23 01:35:40	+naught0	I think not being a dick is pretty easy to understand and relatively universal
2018-09-23 01:35:42	+rocx	being as broad as it gets means that someone could act a certain way just because it isn't specifically defined.
2018-09-23 01:35:58	+brooks	it isn't
2018-09-23 01:36:03	+naught0	I disagree !
2018-09-23 01:36:05	+brooks	I can prove it
2018-09-23 01:36:05	+rocx	could.
2018-09-23 01:36:16	+brooks	...I can't prove it
2018-09-23 01:36:19	+brooks	hold on
2018-09-23 01:37:40	+brooks	naught0: https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/990968833547497472 this thread gets into part of why I think what I think if you're interested
2018-09-23 01:38:10	+naught0	readin
2018-09-23 01:38:20	+LambdaComplex	now seems like a decent time to bring up that post that argued that the rust coc/community/etc was a direct result of everyone being autistic
2018-09-23 01:38:25	+LambdaComplex	lemme try to find it
2018-09-23 01:38:37	+rocx	OH FOR FU-

2018-09-23 01:40:30	+rocx	> It's like the community's interactions have been scripted, to use a programming analogy.
2018-09-23 01:40:30	+rocx	sounds more like an acting/stage play analogy.

2018-09-23 01:43:50	+naught0	let me just say
2018-09-23 01:43:58	+rocx	and considering some people, it's a miracle that there aren't people on "the spectrum" somewhere.
2018-09-23 01:43:58	+naught0	that twitter was the wrong fuckin place to post this
2018-09-23 01:44:08	+rocx	twitter is the wrong place for anything.
2018-09-23 01:44:17	+brooks	I completely agree
2018-09-23 01:44:21	+brooks	twitter killed blogging
2018-09-23 01:44:25	+brooks	and betrayed its devs
2018-09-23 01:44:27	+brooks	social media bad
2018-09-23 01:44:54	+rocx	eh. maybe it's the ecosystem and the fact it's a single place for celebrities.
2018-09-23 01:45:15	+brooks	the ecosystem became what it is because they utilized the devs on their platform to make a shitload of cool apps and shit
2018-09-23 01:45:21	+rocx	celebrities and companies. people can't really strive to be much on twitter unless it's part of some PR campaign or you're famous.
2018-09-23 01:45:23	+brooks	and then they killed that and did their own thing
2018-09-23 01:45:39	+rocx	mastodon feels nicer though but that's just me.
2018-09-23 01:45:50	+brooks	mastodon is a lot nicer

2018-09-23 01:54:47	+rocx	he is.
2018-09-23 01:54:48	+brooks	same
2018-09-23 01:55:00	 *	rocx hasn't seen LTT but that's the impression he gets from hearing people talk about it.
2018-09-23 01:55:14	+naught0	I love linus
2018-09-23 01:55:29	+naught0	he started off real small working for ncix or whatever
2018-09-23 01:55:36	+naught0	and he got so popular he got spun off into a new beast
2018-09-23 01:55:52	+rocx	when you become famous, you have to monetizing for your platform.
2018-09-23 01:55:54	+naught0	they give what I think are relatively balanced reviews of shit
2018-09-23 01:55:56	+rocx	if you don't, you end up like blender.
2018-09-23 01:56:04	+naught0	oof
2018-09-23 01:56:17	+rocx	ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, you can follow peertube channels and such via mastodon.
2018-09-23 01:56:21	+naught0	the creator of blender is all about "fuck u profit" isn't he
2018-09-23 01:56:42	+naught0	peertube?
2018-09-23 01:56:54	+naught0	oh lawd
2018-09-23 01:56:59	+naught0	you open source fruits
2018-09-23 01:57:06	+rocx	dunno. just that youtube took down blender's open movie projects before, "supposedly" some automatic system, probably the fact that blender refuses to monetize their popular videos.
2018-09-23 01:57:20	+rocx	naught0: peertube is like mastodon, but for videos.
2018-09-23 01:57:34	+rocx	and it works via client-side (aka javascript) bittorrent.

2018-09-23 01:58:43	+rocx	ah. my bad for assuming.
2018-09-23 01:58:57	+rocx	mastodon is basically a "federated" microblogging platform.
2018-09-23 01:59:01	+naught0	s'ok I'm usually being a fuck anyway :3
2018-09-23 01:59:10	+naught0	so like libre twitter
2018-09-23 01:59:14	+rocx	think of twitter, but anyone can run their own instance and be able to communicate with other peoples' instances.
2018-09-23 01:59:19	+naught0	oh
2018-09-23 01:59:25	+naught0	that's interesting

2018-09-23 01:59:38	+rocx	it's catching on in the tech scene.
2018-09-23 01:59:42	+naught0	hmmm
2018-09-23 01:59:47	+naught0	that makes sense
2018-09-23 01:59:53	+brooks	it's not just the tech scene
2018-09-23 01:59:58	+naught0	are we sure about that
2018-09-23 01:59:58	+brooks	it has a massive population of leftists
2018-09-23 02:00:00	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-23 02:00:13	+naught0	sounds like you have to be an extremist or technologically inclined
2018-09-23 02:00:23	+brooks	they are not extremist leftists at all
2018-09-23 02:00:25	+rocx	gnu/social was the previous attempt at this feat.
2018-09-23 02:00:27	+brooks	I wish they were more extreme
2018-09-23 02:00:37	+rocx	and it was rather extreme-y.
2018-09-23 02:00:38	+naught0	extremism is scary 1! 
2018-09-23 02:00:43	+brooks	not really

2018-09-23 02:01:25	+naught0	hmmm
2018-09-23 02:01:28	+brooks	being against capitalism already makes you an extremist by most definitions

2018-09-23 02:19:36	+brooks	libreboot is a....not exactly a fork, more like a coreboot distribution
2018-09-23 02:19:43	+brooks	that removes all the non-free stuff
2018-09-23 02:19:52	+brooks	coreboot? nah

2018-09-23 02:38:53	+brooks	go on
2018-09-23 02:39:13	+LambdaComplex	you may find yourself, at some point, looking at a picture and asking yourself "how do i ask my barber/stylist for this haircut?"
2018-09-23 02:39:19	+LambdaComplex	the answer is "bring the damn picture in and show them"

2018-09-23 02:40:16	+naught0	good job barberman
2018-09-23 02:40:19	+brooks	LambdaComplex: my problem is I can't find hairstyles to match my face/hair/etc and I don't know enough, so what I want from a stylist is "I understand this vague thing you're motioning with your hands, I can do that"

2018-09-23 04:33:20	+dysfigured	currently contrapoints "what's wrong with capitalism"
2018-09-23 04:35:15	+brooks	I HATED that one, but even then it's still pretty okay
2018-09-23 04:35:27	+brooks	good choice
2018-09-23 04:35:29	+brooks	what else have you watched
2018-09-23 04:36:03	+dysfigured	i just started
2018-09-23 04:36:21	+dysfigured	i realized i was watching dumb shit on netflix and thought i'd try something more.. substantial?
2018-09-23 04:36:34	+brooks	good plan
2018-09-23 04:37:00	+dysfigured	i like her humor
2018-09-23 04:37:38	+brooks	me too
2018-09-23 04:37:46	+dysfigured	what did you not like about this?
2018-09-23 04:37:52	+brooks	contra is a lib
2018-09-23 04:38:18	+brooks	she doesn't REALLY get what's wrong with capitalism, she's just...doing her best to explain the anxiety of it
2018-09-23 04:38:22	+brooks	and that's good and accessible
2018-09-23 04:38:36	+brooks	but yeah
2018-09-23 04:39:03	+brooks	she actually announced shortly after that she doesn't like making videos like this and she was gonna go back to what she actually Feels
2018-09-23 04:39:09	+dysfigured	>vitalimax for bottoms   dead
2018-09-23 04:39:56	<--	zakame (~zakame@FE6D94BF.A3DFB80C.69376DA6.IP) has quit (Quit: leaving)
2018-09-23 04:40:36	+brooks	yeah, her humor is great
2018-09-23 04:42:22	+brooks	most of the stuff she complained about in this video is like. products of capitalism, yeah, but not in a way that it's clear she understands it as intrinsic to capitalism
2018-09-23 04:42:47	+rocx	ironically on a platform that'll require you to monetize if your channel's popular enough.
2018-09-23 04:42:49	+brooks	and she doesn't demonstrate it as such
2018-09-23 04:42:58	+brooks	she uses patreon
2018-09-23 04:43:01	+brooks	and makes fuckin BANK
2018-09-23 04:43:08	+rocx	meaning youtube.
2018-09-23 04:43:20	+brooks	she hid the #s now, but she's only gotten more popular
2018-09-23 04:43:27	+brooks	six months ago she was making like $5000/mo
2018-09-23 04:43:41	+rocx	so basically a living wage?
2018-09-23 04:43:52	+brooks	to make a video once a month, yeah
2018-09-23 04:44:01	+rocx	hrmph.
2018-09-23 04:44:13	+brooks	not that she doesn't spend hundreds of hours on each video, but yeah
2018-09-23 04:52:31	+dysfigured	>breadmom kropotkin
2018-09-23 04:53:11	+dysfigured	brooks: did you watch part 2? it's going into marxist theory..

2018-09-23 04:56:32	+brooks	oh
2018-09-23 04:56:38	+brooks	I forgot
2018-09-23 04:56:46	+brooks	what the fuck

2018-09-23 04:58:15	+brooks	wait oh yeah
2018-09-23 04:58:16	+brooks	tatiana
2018-09-23 04:58:24	+dysfigured	tatiana?
2018-09-23 04:58:34	+brooks	is in this one
2018-09-23 04:58:37	+brooks	I thought I hit send
2018-09-23 04:58:53	 *	winny licks code
2018-09-23 04:59:23	+brooks	hi winny 
2018-09-23 04:59:31	+brooks	tatiana is a character in this
2018-09-23 04:59:39	+brooks	also I find this whole beginning really misogynistic
2018-09-23 04:59:45	+brooks	it frustrates me
2018-09-23 04:59:58	+brooks	also she doesn't know what the fetishism of the commodity means
2018-09-23 05:00:07	+brooks	she's literally an academic philosopher
2018-09-23 05:00:16	+brooks	who treats philosophy like it's an abstract unreal thing
2018-09-23 05:00:55	+brooks	she's read marx, but doesn't get marx, because she sees it as abstract logic separate from reality
2018-09-23 05:01:14	+brooks	lol zarathustra
2018-09-23 05:01:17	+brooks	>it's zizek
2018-09-23 05:01:19	+brooks	I love that one
2018-09-23 05:01:28	+brooks	anyway yeah marx is .... not like that at all, marx wrote Capital as a *weapon* in the hands of the workers
2018-09-23 05:01:38	+brooks	it's radical, it's real, it's immediate
2018-09-23 05:01:45	+brooks	it is not abstract academic memery
2018-09-23 05:02:22	+dysfigured	i guess i missed the misogyny?
2018-09-23 05:02:24	+brooks	this marxian economic lesson is satire
2018-09-23 05:02:29	+brooks	all of this is bullshit
2018-09-23 05:02:48	+brooks	her criticism is shit, and she doesn't actually understand use value or exchange value
2018-09-23 05:02:53	+brooks	and the deleuze references are bs too
2018-09-23 05:03:34	+brooks	also
2018-09-23 05:03:36	+brooks	gold is poison
2018-09-23 05:03:39	+brooks	it will fucking kill you
2018-09-23 05:03:42	+brooks	eating this is stupid
2018-09-23 05:04:55	+dysfigured	yep
2018-09-23 05:05:06	+dysfigured	see also goldschlager
2018-09-23 05:05:07	+brooks	hmu for a marxian economics lesson later
2018-09-23 05:05:24	+brooks	preferably when I'm sober and you're not tryna binge watch youtube 
2018-09-23 05:05:35	+dysfigured	i will pause the fuck out of youtube for that
2018-09-23 05:06:11	+dysfigured	also [partially?] drunk brooks explaining marxist economics sounds even better
2018-09-23 05:06:14	+brooks	use value and exchange value both exist simultaneously, they are not binary, they are not a dichotomy. everything has both. a thing can't exist without both
2018-09-23 05:06:26	+brooks	under capitalism
2018-09-23 05:06:48	+brooks	"the lizards are capital itself"
2018-09-23 05:06:52	+brooks	actually no
2018-09-23 05:06:58	+brooks	the lizards are *the commodity*
2018-09-23 05:07:04	+brooks	as a form
2018-09-23 05:07:22	+brooks	I'll make this...more complete, at least, maybe not more coherent
2018-09-23 05:07:25	+brooks	at the end
2018-09-23 05:07:48	+brooks	>should the economy serve humanity or should humanity serve the economy
2018-09-23 05:07:54	+brooks	neither, the economy is a product of capitalism tbh
2018-09-23 05:08:02	+brooks	this is complicated, it's not really that clear
2018-09-23 05:08:12	+brooks	but communism is, in several ways, the abolition of economies
2018-09-23 05:08:14	+brooks	period
2018-09-23 05:09:42	+dysfigured	>but muh scarcity
2018-09-23 05:09:50	+brooks	scarcity isn't real
2018-09-23 05:09:55	+brooks	it hasn't been real for decades
2018-09-23 05:10:09	+dysfigured	EVERYTHING IS FINITE THEREFORE EVERYTHING IS SCARCE
2018-09-23 05:10:16	+brooks	not in any real way
2018-09-23 05:10:22	+dysfigured	^ actual argument thrown to me
2018-09-23 05:10:31	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-23 05:10:34	+brooks	it's a nerd argument
2018-09-23 05:10:36	+brooks	fuck nerds
2018-09-23 05:10:57	+dysfigured	i mean i kinda basically pretty much identify as a nerd
2018-09-23 05:11:44	+brooks	yeah, I'm using it to refer to something...else
2018-09-23 05:11:51	+brooks	I'm a nerd in all the same ways as you, I think?
2018-09-23 05:11:53	+brooks	like as far as I know
2018-09-23 05:12:11	+brooks	tatiana
2018-09-23 05:12:21	+brooks	this was
2018-09-23 05:12:23	+brooks	frustrating
2018-09-23 05:12:37	+brooks	hopefully for reasons you don't need me to explain
2018-09-23 05:12:48	+brooks	is the person doing the 'rebuttals' here claudia brown
2018-09-23 05:13:09	+brooks	I think so
2018-09-23 05:13:12	+brooks	she's a fuckin lib too
2018-09-23 05:13:38	+brooks	that version of the soviet anthem was kinda awesome
2018-09-23 05:14:13	+dysfigured	ikr
2018-09-23 05:15:09	+brooks	communism isn't about *re*distribution
2018-09-23 05:15:41	+brooks	yeah marx got this wrong
2018-09-23 05:15:51	+brooks	if you wanna watch a video about why
2018-09-23 05:15:53	+dysfigured	tfw still no transexual gandhi

2018-09-23 05:18:32	+brooks	oh, my condolences
2018-09-23 05:18:39	+dysfigured	it took me an hour just to type contrapoints
2018-09-23 05:18:53	+brooks	can you navigate channels
2018-09-23 05:19:14	+dysfigured	h/o i think there's a way to sync this

2018-09-23 05:20:35	+brooks	either
2018-09-23 05:20:37	+brooks	let's see
2018-09-23 05:22:04	+dysfigured	tfw kinda want a physical copy of the bread book but also don't want someone generating profits from a critique of capitalism
2018-09-23 05:23:01	+brooks	relatable
2018-09-23 05:23:09	+brooks	look into printing your own books
2018-09-23 05:23:12	+brooks	there are some good guides
2018-09-23 05:24:02	+dysfigured	sounds expensive
2018-09-23 05:24:09	+brooks	less than buying books iirc
2018-09-23 05:24:10	+dysfigured	like at minimum the cost of a printer
2018-09-23 05:24:26	+brooks	anyway I can't join you for this video but I'm pretty sure this is the one that explains where marx got the fall of capitalism wrong
2018-09-23 05:24:40	+brooks	oh you don't own a printer
2018-09-23 05:24:43	+brooks	I forgot that's normal now
2018-09-23 05:24:55	+brooks	hi Cosumu, sorry, I was replying to you and then I was like oh I'll just wait for them to continue
2018-09-23 05:24:59	+brooks	but u didn't
2018-09-23 05:25:38	+dysfigured	so far it's just explaining antifa
2018-09-23 05:25:46	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-23 05:26:02	+brooks	it explains that fascism is the immune system of capitalism
2018-09-23 05:26:05	+Cosumu	o
2018-09-23 05:26:05	+brooks	I think
2018-09-23 05:26:08	 *	Cosumu pets brooks
2018-09-23 05:26:11	+brooks	cute
2018-09-23 05:26:34	+Cosumu	whomst is a brooks
2018-09-23 05:26:46	+dysfigured	side note: would one consider mexico the closest thing to actual fascism?
2018-09-23 05:27:02	+Cosumu	no
2018-09-23 05:27:07	+Cosumu	mexico is just lowercase america
2018-09-23 05:27:07	+brooks	what? no
2018-09-23 05:27:25	+brooks	what do you base that on
2018-09-23 05:27:40	+dysfigured	considering how they have one oil company, one phone company, one etc
2018-09-23 05:27:53	+brooks	oh
2018-09-23 05:27:56	+brooks	no
2018-09-23 05:28:13	+dysfigured	it's like they just decided "fuck choices, you'll get what you're given and like it"
2018-09-23 05:28:17	+brooks	fascism is ... much more specific than that
2018-09-23 05:28:46	+dysfigured	and those companies end up with a shit ton of leverage in their areas
2018-09-23 05:28:53	+dysfigured	i wouldn't say it *is* actual fascism
2018-09-23 05:29:11	+dysfigured	but it seems like the closest thing going
2018-09-23 05:29:14	+brooks	I would say it's more like authoritarian than fascist
2018-09-23 05:29:24	+brooks	there are a lot of places that are like, actually moving toward fascism
2018-09-23 05:29:35	+dysfigured	hm
2018-09-23 05:30:05	+brooks	italy pretty recently, I heard poland even more recently
2018-09-23 05:30:17	+brooks	there's rising fascist movements in lots of countries, besides all that
2018-09-23 05:30:56	+dysfigured	oh he's p much about to school me on my exact question
2018-09-23 05:31:36	+Cosumu	i am a facist
2018-09-23 05:31:51	+Cosumu	but only to myself

2018-09-23 05:54:11	+brooks	nice
2018-09-23 05:58:30	+brooks	dysfigured: if you want to understand the law of value it's literally laid out in chapter one btw
2018-09-23 05:58:43	+brooks	it's not that complicated
2018-09-23 05:59:54	+dysfigured	chapter one of..? the manifesto?
2018-09-23 06:00:19	+brooks	of Capital
2018-09-23 06:00:25	+brooks	the manifesto isn't theory
2018-09-23 06:00:33	+dysfigured	ah
2018-09-23 06:01:16	+brooks	actually I think I wrote this breakdown before
2018-09-23 06:01:20	+brooks	basically
2018-09-23 06:01:44	+brooks	if the exchange value is just the price, where does the price come from
2018-09-23 06:02:00	+brooks	the standard explanation today is that "value is subjective and people pay what things are worth to them"
2018-09-23 06:02:19	+dysfigured	you need a blog
2018-09-23 06:02:29	+brooks	Marx wanted a more scientific explanation, he said if you weigh something, you're weighing it on a scale, using, say, iron
2018-09-23 06:02:44	+brooks	and in this context the iron isn't serving as iron, it's serving as an abstraction of weight
2018-09-23 06:03:18	+brooks	so to measure exchange value, price, you need an equivalent to the iron, something that can serve as both what it actually is and as that abstraction
2018-09-23 06:03:42	+brooks	and he then illustrates pretty clearly that the thing that serves as this abstraction is the labor within capitalist society
2018-09-23 06:03:47	+brooks	not in some naive sense, not like
2018-09-23 06:04:01	+brooks	"I built this, it took 16 hours, so it's worth what I should be paid for 16 hours of labor"
2018-09-23 06:05:03	+brooks	but more like "people's concept of what something is worth comes from their relationship to labor and production"
2018-09-23 06:05:17	+brooks	that's the thing that serves as both itself (iron, money) and as an abstraction (weight, price)
2018-09-23 06:05:30	+brooks	when you put it like that, it's just, obvious. like a truism
2018-09-23 06:06:11	+brooks	yeah I do need a blog
2018-09-23 06:06:39	+brooks	everything else stems from this
2018-09-23 06:06:52	+brooks	oh yeah to tie this back into what I said earlier
2018-09-23 06:06:58	+brooks	exchange value, use value
2018-09-23 06:07:33	+brooks	these are different forms in which value manifests
2018-09-23 06:07:55	+brooks	under capitalism, anything produced is produced for the purpose of exchange or in the context of production for the purpose of exchange
2018-09-23 06:08:32	+brooks	if you make a chair, you understand it in the context of chairs as a commodity. if you make chairs to sell, like ron swanson, you're making them not because you love chairs but because they're exchangeable
2018-09-23 06:08:58	+brooks	and so, the person obtaining the chair is willing to pay the price for it, but they're willing to pay that because it's a chair, because its use value is intrinsic
2018-09-23 06:09:56	+brooks	xexizy is right that all this gets complicated as you examine different facets, and marx is very exacting in his writing about it
2018-09-23 06:10:01	+brooks	almost mathematical
2018-09-23 06:10:05	+brooks	but the basic ideas are, well, basic
2018-09-23 06:10:13	+brooks	and it's not that difficult
2018-09-23 06:11:09	+brooks	I can tie this into other shit, but I've monologued enough for rn
2018-09-23 06:11:15	+brooks	maybe I'll write some blog posts or something

2018-09-23 16:22:44	+mobo	no
2018-09-23 16:23:08	+LambdaComplex	I met a man with a diatonic accordion at a music festival
2018-09-23 16:23:20	+LambdaComplex	I found that its tuning was remarkably similar to that of the diatonic harmonica
2018-09-23 16:23:45	+brooks	also I got it out for a quick check the other day and was able to blow single notes? need more practice but was surprised
2018-09-23 16:23:49	+LambdaComplex	I was able to play a few simple minor key melodies (e.g. Scarborough Fair) within about 15 minutes, despite having never played accordion before

2018-09-23 18:33:55	+brooks	am I wrong for thinking the first red flag here is this dude referring to himself as having "a full understanding of the redhad security methods"
2018-09-23 18:34:06	+Nux	literally anything he said
2018-09-23 18:34:08	+Nux	tbh

2018-09-23 18:37:51	+brooks	I want you all to think about this for a second:
2018-09-23 18:38:02	+Nux	ive gotten cease and desist letters before
2018-09-23 18:38:03	+brooks	you are more competent than people like this and they work in your industry
2018-09-23 18:38:05	+Nux	theyre fun
2018-09-23 18:38:18	+brooks	fuck impostor syndrome
2018-09-23 18:38:20	+Kirjava	brooks: this is surely an anomalous example
2018-09-23 18:38:22	+brooks	it's important
2018-09-23 18:38:27	+brooks	you'd be surprised
2018-09-23 18:38:29	+Ivion	Kirjava: I fucking hope so
2018-09-23 18:38:35	+Ivion	shit's depressing
2018-09-23 18:38:40	+Kirjava	brooks: not rare, but not common
2018-09-23 18:38:50	+Nux	Kirjava: no this is a common example
2018-09-23 18:38:51	+LambdaComplex	brooks: but my sanity hinges upon never internalizing that fact
2018-09-23 18:38:52	+Nux	tbh
2018-09-23 18:38:53	+brooks	it's unusually *bad* but this kind of thing it pretty common
2018-09-23 18:38:53	+LambdaComplex	;-;
2018-09-23 18:38:56	+lvmbdv	+1 fuck impostor syndrome :\
2018-09-23 18:39:09	+Kirjava	sure. the severity is what is anomalous I gues
2018-09-23 18:39:19	+LambdaComplex	hey bdelloid can we become farmers? 
2018-09-23 18:39:29	+LambdaComplex	we can raise goats and grow tobacco and cotton
2018-09-23 18:39:39	+Kirjava	and smoke the cotton
2018-09-23 18:39:39	+Nux	like when tmobile autstria on twitter said "our security is super duper good" in response to it being outed they stored passwords in plain text
2018-09-23 18:39:46	+Nux	and who got owned hard this summer

2018-09-23 18:40:01	+Kirjava	being dumb
2018-09-23 18:40:03	+Nux	and practices
2018-09-23 18:40:05	+brooks	hey LambdaComplex have you read that article about the guy who started a startup where you send a photo of your junk and it tells you whether or not you have an std
2018-09-23 18:40:08	+Nux	they stored passwords in plain text
2018-09-23 18:40:17	+LambdaComplex	brooks: no i have not
2018-09-23 18:40:21	--	mobo_ is now known as mobo
2018-09-23 18:40:45	+brooks	he got quick bux, started doing coke, banged a hooker, had the db get leaked right before a multimillion dollar sale, lost the sale, got an std, and retired to a farm in alabama
2018-09-23 18:40:54	+Kirjava	Nux: being able to recover passwords is a basic part of any PCI compliant system
2018-09-23 18:41:06	+Kirjava	no wonder they store them in plaintext tbh

2018-09-23 18:52:03	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, is slavery still legal there?
2018-09-23 18:52:26	+Nux	in a sense
2018-09-23 18:53:07	+bdelloid	do niggers still work the fields?
2018-09-23 18:53:12	+Kirjava	oof
2018-09-23 18:53:15	+Nux	probably
2018-09-23 18:53:20	+bdelloid	nice
2018-09-23 18:53:28	+bdelloid	they probably get paid less than minimum wage
2018-09-23 18:53:32	+bdelloid	which is just enough to feed and house them
2018-09-23 18:53:35	+Nux	naw thats the mexicans
2018-09-23 18:53:40	+bdelloid	which they were already getting when they were slaves
2018-09-23 18:53:43	+bdelloid	dumbfucks
2018-09-23 18:53:56	+LambdaComplex	note to self: stop highlighting bdelloid 
2018-09-23 18:53:56	+Nux	ya well they arent owned
2018-09-23 18:53:58	+bdelloid	tfw universal slavery became real
2018-09-23 18:53:58	+Nux	so
2018-09-23 18:54:01	+bdelloid	they are
2018-09-23 18:54:07	+bdelloid	by the state tho
2018-09-23 18:54:11	+bdelloid	instead of a private entity
2018-09-23 18:54:11	+Nux	not in the sense of full on slavery
2018-09-23 18:54:14	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, I'm extremely bored, sorry
2018-09-23 18:54:22	+Nux	i need cigs

2018-09-23 18:54:45	+Nux	you walked in the rain once
2018-09-23 18:54:45	+bdelloid	and my new phone and bone conduction headphones would get ruined
2018-09-23 18:54:49	+Nux	and fucked your shoe up
2018-09-23 18:54:51	+Nux	i remember that
2018-09-23 18:55:05	+bdelloid	bone conduction headphones are pretty neat
2018-09-23 18:55:24	+Nux	tf is that
2018-09-23 18:55:46	+bdelloid	they go on the bone instead of inside or over the ear
2018-09-23 18:55:48	+bdelloid	so you can hear the outside
2018-09-23 18:55:50	+bdelloid	while listening to music
2018-09-23 18:55:55	+bdelloid	it's like having constant background music

2018-09-23 19:01:41	+rocx	somehow in a dream.
2018-09-23 19:01:47	+LambdaComplex	well, i could use a mirror
2018-09-23 19:01:56	+LambdaComplex	but everyone knows you're not supposed to look at your reflection in a dream
2018-09-23 19:02:01	+brooks	rocx: ayyyy
2018-09-23 19:02:14	+rocx	every time i somehow did, my teeth were fifty sorts of messed up.
2018-09-23 19:02:16	+brooks	LambdaComplex: wait what, I thought looking at your reflection was one of the basic reality checks
2018-09-23 19:02:20	+LambdaComplex	rocx: I TOLD YOU
2018-09-23 19:02:21	+rocx	like even teeth that are way too big.

2018-09-23 22:53:54	+trinary	Which one did you do?

2018-09-23 22:54:10	+trinary	Yeah, that one's boring
2018-09-23 22:54:11	+mobo	can you start at a different one?

2018-09-23 22:54:21	+mobo	what do you recommend starting with?
2018-09-23 22:54:44	+trinary	vortex is hard
2018-09-23 22:55:01	+mobo	I'm gonna try levinthian, it looks short
2018-09-23 22:55:13	+LambdaComplex	yeah bandit is super ez for anyone who already uses linux
2018-09-23 22:55:20	+LambdaComplex	i'd rec leviathan
2018-09-23 22:55:35	+LambdaComplex	(like, level 0 of bandit is just "cat this file" or some shit)

2018-09-24 00:21:04	+LambdaComplex	hi brooks 
2018-09-24 00:21:10	+LambdaComplex	can you mail me some sheet metal
2018-09-24 00:21:30	+LambdaComplex	where the fuck do you even buy sheet metal
2018-09-24 00:21:32	 *	LambdaComplex checks Lowes
2018-09-24 00:22:02	+Kirjava	any decent pharmacy carries sheet metal
2018-09-24 00:22:11	+LambdaComplex	wat
2018-09-24 00:22:50	+brooks	I have no idea
2018-09-24 00:23:47	+LambdaComplex	lowes does not have much copper sheet metal listed online
2018-09-24 00:24:10	 *	LambdaComplex tries amazon
2018-09-24 00:24:29	+LambdaComplex	>$14 for a square foot
2018-09-24 00:24:34	+LambdaComplex	i just remembered copper is expensive
2018-09-24 00:24:39	+bdelloid	raaahhh
2018-09-24 00:24:45	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: why are you awake
2018-09-24 00:24:49	+brooks	steal some
2018-09-24 00:24:50	+Kirjava	hi bdelloid 
2018-09-24 00:24:53	+brooks	lots of old houses have spare copper
2018-09-24 00:24:55	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, it's 19:25
2018-09-24 00:24:56	+Kirjava	im talking to HR tomorrow
2018-09-24 00:24:58	+Kirjava	any tips
2018-09-24 00:25:01	+bdelloid	Kirjava, hi
2018-09-24 00:25:05	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-24 00:25:11	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: you're hanging out with your girlfriend, aren't you?
2018-09-24 00:25:27	+LambdaComplex	sorry i just assume you're in germany
2018-09-24 00:25:29	+LambdaComplex	:3
2018-09-24 00:25:29	+darkwater	Kirjava: what do you do
2018-09-24 00:25:35	+bdelloid	Kirjava, not really
2018-09-24 00:25:36	+darkwater	whats your job
2018-09-24 00:25:38	+bdelloid	just be yourself
2018-09-24 00:25:40	+Cosumu	o
2018-09-24 00:25:42	+Kirjava	okay ^_^
2018-09-24 00:25:45	+bdelloid	keep in mind she doesn't know shit about anything technical
2018-09-24 00:25:53	+bdelloid	and whatever you say to her is going to come to me garbled
2018-09-24 00:25:55	+LambdaComplex	so just say a bunch of buzzwords? :^)
2018-09-24 00:26:01	+bdelloid	no, don't do that
2018-09-24 00:26:07	+Kirjava	darkwater: I do web/app atm, but the HR interview is for a palce at bdelloid's work doing RUST
2018-09-24 00:26:09	+darkwater	dont mention blockchains
2018-09-24 00:26:15	+darkwater	ooo
2018-09-24 00:26:20	+bdelloid	don't mention blockchains
2018-09-24 00:26:27	+bdelloid	but keep in mind we use blockchain technology
2018-09-24 00:26:31	+Kirjava	o_O
2018-09-24 00:26:32	+darkwater	fuck
2018-09-24 00:26:32	+LambdaComplex	"yeah bdelloid he said he was using some city in Japan to build a web server or something idk"
2018-09-24 00:26:37	+Kirjava	lmao
2018-09-24 00:26:38	+isk	https://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/67750343#p67759910
2018-09-24 00:26:59	+Kirjava	well I was thinking I should mention that you do open source stuff and I like that probably
2018-09-24 00:27:18	+LambdaComplex	isk: wut
2018-09-24 00:27:27	+Kirjava	idk we will seee
2018-09-24 00:27:57	+isk	basically
2018-09-24 00:28:01	+isk	in Linus' memo
2018-09-24 00:28:13	+isk	he has inconsistent unicode pointed quote marks
2018-09-24 00:28:18	+isk	regular ascii quotes
2018-09-24 00:28:23	+LambdaComplex	yeah i caught that
2018-09-24 00:28:23	+isk	and 2 apostrophes in a row
2018-09-24 00:28:25	+LambdaComplex	but
2018-09-24 00:28:29	+isk	they think it's a duress code
2018-09-24 00:28:36	+LambdaComplex	how do they come to that conclusion?
2018-09-24 00:28:36	+brooks	lol
2018-09-24 00:28:38	+LambdaComplex	that's what i don't get
2018-09-24 00:28:54	+brooks	linus finally realizes he was too much of an asshole for several years and is understandably distraught by this
2018-09-24 00:28:58	+isk	because you would anticipate Linus is smart enough to not use two apostrophes as a quote
2018-09-24 00:29:06	+brooks	but clearly there must be a conspiracy
2018-09-24 00:29:11	+Kirjava	people will read into things what they want to
2018-09-24 00:29:17	+Kirjava	just look at the qanon shit
2018-09-24 00:29:23	+isk	well this is a more interesting story anyway
2018-09-24 00:29:24	+brooks	Kirjava++
2018-09-24 00:29:29	+LambdaComplex	brooks: hell, i can even understand people wondering about a conspiracy
2018-09-24 00:29:30	+isk	I literally have no idea what's happening with Linus
2018-09-24 00:29:31	+LambdaComplex	but....quotes?
2018-09-24 00:29:39	+isk	I'm just reading /g/ for funzies
2018-09-24 00:29:39	+LambdaComplex	that's their evidence??
2018-09-24 00:29:42	+darkwater	LambdaComplex: dont you think its weird
2018-09-24 00:29:43	+isk	no?
2018-09-24 00:29:46	+darkwater	why are some smart and some ascii
2018-09-24 00:29:48	+Kirjava	linus is busy making the next linux/git now
2018-09-24 00:29:50	+isk	it's not "evidence"
2018-09-24 00:29:54	+Kirjava	LEAVE HIM ALONE >:|
2018-09-24 00:30:02	+isk	it's "maybe there is something to this"
2018-09-24 00:30:07	+darkwater	Kirjava: linux 2 with native windows executable support?
2018-09-24 00:30:17	+Kirjava	lmao linux 2
2018-09-24 00:30:25	+Kirjava	isk: why speculate wildly with no evidence
2018-09-24 00:30:39	+Kirjava	just wait for confirmz
2018-09-24 00:30:45	+brooks	conspiracy theories in a nutshell
2018-09-24 00:31:30	+brooks	I'm guessing the quotes are the result of a bug in some software or something, or maybe it's for emphasis, who fucking knows
2018-09-24 00:31:40	+brooks	uninteresting, wake me up when september ends, etc
2018-09-24 00:32:09	+Kirjava	maybe there's a chocolate teapot orbiting mars
2018-09-24 00:32:19	+darkwater	Cosumu: that u?
2018-09-24 00:32:27	+Cosumu	wait

2018-09-24 00:39:11	+brooks	well that answers that
2018-09-24 00:39:14	+dysfigured	oh what
2018-09-24 00:39:32	+dysfigured	gotta be a gitlab issue
2018-09-24 00:40:36	+brooks	guessing it's a DNS issue
2018-09-24 00:43:00	+LambdaComplex	there are two A records for git.danielfgray.com
2018-09-24 00:43:02	+LambdaComplex	is this intentional
2018-09-24 00:43:14	+mobo	yeah, the other is mine
2018-09-24 00:43:24	+dysfigured	say what
2018-09-24 00:43:40	+LambdaComplex	git.danielfgray.com. 1799 IN A 192.64.119.254
2018-09-24 00:43:42	+LambdaComplex	git.danielfgray.com. 1799 IN A 192.81.129.202
2018-09-24 00:43:55	+brooks	which one is right
2018-09-24 00:44:26	+LambdaComplex	the .202 one has rDNS pointing to danielfgray.com
2018-09-24 00:44:42	+brooks	rDNS?
2018-09-24 00:44:46	+LambdaComplex	reverse DNS
2018-09-24 00:44:48	+LambdaComplex	i.e. PTR record
2018-09-24 00:45:18	+LambdaComplex	and danielfgray.com <-> 192.81.129.202 FCrDNS checks out
2018-09-24 00:46:32	+dysfigured	that's super weird.
2018-09-24 00:46:46	+LambdaComplex	well fix it!!!
2018-09-24 00:46:47	+dysfigured	how'd you do this from cli?

2018-09-24 00:50:40	+dysfigured	maybe i just set it up dum
2018-09-24 00:50:52	+LambdaComplex	well feepharm.greatnow.com and milochka.greatnow.com both point to that IP too
2018-09-24 00:50:54	+dysfigured	i mean i do have two a records listed here but for @ and * hosts
2018-09-24 00:51:00	+dysfigured	same ip

2018-09-24 00:52:32	+LambdaComplex	dysfigured: did you register that domain through enom?
2018-09-24 00:52:37	+dysfigured	namecheap
2018-09-24 00:52:42	+Kirjava	lamecheap

2018-09-24 00:53:05	+LambdaComplex	looks like it's pointing at an enom nameserver
2018-09-24 00:53:08	+LambdaComplex	[thinking emoji]
2018-09-24 00:53:47	+dysfigured	what nameserver should i use
2018-09-24 00:54:07	+LambdaComplex	oh, are you using enom's nameservers on purpose
2018-09-24 00:54:09	+LambdaComplex	?
2018-09-24 00:54:10	+dysfigured	no
2018-09-24 00:54:50	+LambdaComplex	so how are you handling dns for that domain
2018-09-24 00:54:58	+dysfigured	namecheap does it?
2018-09-24 00:55:01	+dysfigured	idk
2018-09-24 00:55:41	+dysfigured	idk what any of this shit is, i bought a domain from namecheap and tried to point it at the ip linode, and then i tried to make sure all subdomains go to my ip too
2018-09-24 00:56:21	+LambdaComplex	when was the last time you edited the DNS records?
2018-09-24 00:56:39	+dysfigured	i mean i'm logged in rn looking for problems
2018-09-24 00:56:44	+LambdaComplex	oh ok
2018-09-24 00:56:52	+dysfigured	it uses some namecheap nameserver, i can change it tho
2018-09-24 00:56:55	+LambdaComplex	are there any txt records in place?
2018-09-24 00:57:05	+brooks	isn't this what cname is for
2018-09-24 00:57:10	+LambdaComplex	brooks: ?
2018-09-24 00:57:36	+dysfigured	LambdaComplex: v=spf1 include:spf.efwd.registrar-servers.com ~all
2018-09-24 00:57:40	+dysfigured	what is this
2018-09-24 00:57:46	+LambdaComplex	an spf record
2018-09-24 00:57:52	+dysfigured	what that is
2018-09-24 00:58:13	+LambdaComplex	it's used for verifying email for a domain is coming from a server that's authorized to send email on behalf of that domain
2018-09-24 00:58:24	 *	dysfigured nods
2018-09-24 00:58:45	+LambdaComplex	okay are you seeing the two A records listed?
2018-09-24 00:58:54	+LambdaComplex	also Nux are you here
2018-09-24 00:59:23	+dysfigured	https://u.teknik.io/ZsFen.png
2018-09-24 00:59:28	+LambdaComplex	haha holy shit did it actually just respond to an ANY
2018-09-24 00:59:41	+LambdaComplex	man that's fucked up
2018-09-24 01:01:03	+dysfigured	O.o
2018-09-24 01:01:19	+LambdaComplex	but
2018-09-24 01:01:22	+LambdaComplex	git.danielfgray.com. 1798 IN A 192.64.119.254
2018-09-24 01:01:25	+LambdaComplex	you're not seeing that record listed?
2018-09-24 01:02:03	+dysfigured	no
2018-09-24 01:02:14	+dysfigured	i set up wildcards for subdomains
2018-09-24 01:03:02	+LambdaComplex	Well that's not good!
2018-09-24 01:03:18	+dysfigured	wym
2018-09-24 01:03:34	+Uncled1023	I have wildcard setup and it works just fine
2018-09-24 01:03:57	+LambdaComplex	dysfigured: What nameserver does namecheap's settings say it's using?
2018-09-24 01:04:15	 *	LambdaComplex runs ''dig danielfgray.com ns +trace''
2018-09-24 01:04:25	+dysfigured	"namecheap basic dns"
2018-09-24 01:04:39	+LambdaComplex	Does it not actually specify the server names?
2018-09-24 01:04:47	+dysfigured	not afaict
2018-09-24 01:05:04	+LambdaComplex	okay just found a thing saying those servers _are_ right
2018-09-24 01:05:09	+LambdaComplex	guess they just use enom's shit on the backend
2018-09-24 01:05:35	+LambdaComplex	so, i'm going to preface this by saying that there's of course the possibility that I'm interpreting all this shit wrong
2018-09-24 01:05:37	+LambdaComplex	but
2018-09-24 01:05:46	+LambdaComplex	i'm honestly wondering if enom's DNS servers got hacked
2018-09-24 01:05:59	+brooks	yw
2018-09-24 01:06:02	+LambdaComplex	i'd open a ticket with namecheap if i were you
2018-09-24 01:06:04	+LambdaComplex	brooks: w-what
2018-09-24 01:06:24	+dysfigured	brooks was the catalyst of your discovery
2018-09-24 01:06:29	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-24 01:06:31	+LambdaComplex	tru
2018-09-24 01:07:05	+dysfigured	linode has one i can use maybe i should do that
2018-09-24 01:08:54	+LambdaComplex	dysfigured: "I'm using your namecheap basic dns for my danielfgray.com domain.

2018-09-24 01:08:56	+LambdaComplex	may be related to malware in some way. Could you please look into this and provide an explanation?"
2018-09-24 01:08:59	+LambdaComplex	just open a ticket with them saying that

2018-09-24 02:47:40	+Leliana	you just have to use oauth instead of plain imap login

2018-09-24 15:12:46	+LambdaComplex	i think at most places hr cares more than the people who actually know stuff
2018-09-24 15:13:16	+LambdaComplex	hell lemme just quote the email

2018-09-24 16:32:00	+Kirjava	is murder legal in germany
2018-09-24 16:32:04	+bdelloid	yes
2018-09-24 16:32:12	+bdelloid	it's not murder if it's consensual
2018-09-24 16:32:16	+Kirjava	aha
2018-09-24 16:32:20	+bdelloid	or it would be rape even when it's consensual
2018-09-24 16:32:33	+Kirjava	that's why the guy that wanted to be eaten did it in germany
2018-09-24 16:32:34	+Kirjava	but of course

2018-09-24 21:19:11	+bdelloid	and my new headphones
2018-09-24 21:19:15	+LambdaComplex	i'd be happy if they could work things out
2018-09-24 21:19:19	+bdelloid	but they don't fill the void inside my chest
2018-09-24 21:19:19	+brooks	what kind of phone is it bdelloid 
2018-09-24 21:19:25	+Kirjava	I mean
2018-09-24 21:19:25	+bdelloid	brooks, I got a Xiaomi Mi Mix 2
2018-09-24 21:19:29	+brooks	nice
2018-09-24 21:19:33	+LambdaComplex	hey brooks when are we gonna write The Ultimate Unix Shell in rust
2018-09-24 21:19:35	+bdelloid	it's really pretty
2018-09-24 21:19:38	+Kirjava	normaly tv show rules dictaste that him and emily gonna be shipped so
2018-09-24 21:19:43	+bdelloid	and I don't get affected by the retarded front camera location
2018-09-24 21:19:48	+bdelloid	because I don't take pictures of myself
2018-09-24 21:19:58	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: or maybe Henry Fondle will rise from the grave and steal emily from him
2018-09-24 21:20:01	+LambdaComplex	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-09-24 21:20:06	+Kirjava	the dream
2018-09-24 21:20:48	+brooks	LambdaComplex: I only want to write a shell if it will actually be an improvement tho
2018-09-24 21:20:54	+brooks	and that seems like a high bar
2018-09-24 21:21:01	+LambdaComplex	brooks: i mean that's kind what Ultimate would mean
2018-09-24 21:21:06	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-24 21:21:07	+LambdaComplex	brooks: ....idk how to do that though
2018-09-24 21:21:08	+bdelloid	ok
2018-09-24 21:21:09	+bdelloid	ok
2018-09-24 21:21:10	+bdelloid	bois
2018-09-24 21:21:11	+LambdaComplex	ok
2018-09-24 21:21:12	+bdelloid	here's what we do
2018-09-24 21:21:13	+LambdaComplex	wassup
2018-09-24 21:21:14	+bdelloid	PowerShell
2018-09-24 21:21:15	+LambdaComplex	uh huh
2018-09-24 21:21:16	+bdelloid	but good
2018-09-24 21:21:17	+LambdaComplex	ok
2018-09-24 21:21:21	+LambdaComplex	that's just what i was thinking!
2018-09-24 21:21:23	+LambdaComplex	well
2018-09-24 21:21:25	+LambdaComplex	actually
2018-09-24 21:21:35	+LambdaComplex	i was thinking "could we make the whole powershell object model work?"
2018-09-24 21:21:39	+bdelloid	no
2018-09-24 21:21:41	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-24 21:21:46	+bdelloid	same perspective, different model
2018-09-24 21:21:51	+LambdaComplex	wdym
2018-09-24 21:21:59	+Kirjava	did some fuck just say powershell
2018-09-24 21:22:02	+Kirjava	BEGONE
2018-09-24 21:22:02	+bdelloid	the perspective is
2018-09-24 21:22:19	+bdelloid	"text sucks for this"
2018-09-24 21:22:22	+bdelloid	and the model is
2018-09-24 21:22:44	+bdelloid	anything but "what if we tried to shoehorn .NET into a shell"
2018-09-24 21:22:54	+LambdaComplex	i think the only reason powershell manages to get away with being how it is is because MS designed the entire system from the ground up to have the concept of objects
2018-09-24 21:23:01	+LambdaComplex	whereas *nix has decades of baggage where everything is text
2018-09-24 21:23:03	+LambdaComplex	which makes them
2018-09-24 21:23:04	+bdelloid	and .NET was "what if we made .COM slightly saner"
2018-09-24 21:23:04	+LambdaComplex	not work together
2018-09-24 21:23:14	+Kirjava	bobject oriented programming
2018-09-24 21:23:16	+LambdaComplex	someone correct me if i'm wrong
2018-09-24 21:23:20	+Kirjava	ur wrong
2018-09-24 21:23:23	+Kirjava	feel corrected
2018-09-24 21:23:23	+LambdaComplex	how so

2018-09-24 21:23:30	+LambdaComplex	pls
2018-09-24 21:23:32	+Kirjava	no
2018-09-24 21:23:39	+bdelloid	what we need
2018-09-24 21:23:41	+bdelloid	is functional programming
2018-09-24 21:23:43	+brooks	I'm pretty sure you're wrong 
2018-09-24 21:23:43	+bdelloid	but in shell form
2018-09-24 21:23:48	+bdelloid	actually
2018-09-24 21:23:55	+bdelloid	let's make a shell based on Prolog
2018-09-24 21:23:59	+LambdaComplex	brooks: how so??
2018-09-24 21:23:59	+Kirjava	functional programming is the best programming
2018-09-24 21:24:02	+bdelloid	`echo foo`
2018-09-24 21:24:04	+bdelloid	> yes
2018-09-24 21:24:13	+bdelloid	`cat /dev/random`
2018-09-24 21:24:14	+bdelloid	> no
2018-09-24 21:24:27	+LambdaComplex	let's make a shell based on ed(1)
2018-09-24 21:24:29	+LambdaComplex	`echo foo`
2018-09-24 21:24:30	+LambdaComplex	> ?
2018-09-24 21:24:33	+LambdaComplex	`cat /dev/random`
2018-09-24 21:24:35	+LambdaComplex	> ?
2018-09-24 21:24:42	+brooks	LambdaComplex: Microsoft is backward compatible with a bunch of shit that's still expected to work too
2018-09-24 21:25:03	+brooks	I can't say for sure though 
2018-09-24 21:25:06	+LambdaComplex	brooks: okay, now go find someone advocating you use that shit when there's a powershell cmdlet that does the same thing
2018-09-24 21:25:18	+LambdaComplex	(you're not wrong though)
2018-09-24 21:25:36	+Kirjava	that's sexist
2018-09-24 21:25:38	+brooks	yeah it's the ground up part that I tho k doesn't fit 
2018-09-24 21:25:43	+brooks	the rest probably does

2018-09-24 21:26:27	+Kirjava	no u
2018-09-24 21:27:40	+brooks	I actually agree about the functional programming thing
2018-09-24 21:27:46	+brooks	in the shell
2018-09-24 21:27:56	+brooks	it doesn't really make sense as fp proper 
2018-09-24 21:27:59	+brooks	but
2018-09-24 21:28:42	+brooks	a shell that you can write in without making changes to the system
2018-09-24 21:28:46	+brooks	unless you're explicit

2018-09-24 21:29:02	+dysfigured	wait what did i miss
2018-09-24 21:29:04	+brooks	especially if you add in mocks

Yes, hitchhiking became associated with socialism and communism. J. Edgar Hoover in particular had it out for student activists, and he
2018-09-25 02:24:24	+LambdaComplex	directed an anti-hitchhiking campaign that stressed the dangers of the practice both for the hitchhiker and the person picking up the hitchhiker.

2018-09-25 02:31:26	+brooks	yes
2018-09-25 02:31:31	+brooks	this fits with a bunch of shit
2018-09-25 02:31:41	+brooks	it also didn't really become fully dead until relatively recently
2018-09-25 02:31:51	+brooks	throughout the 90s it was still relatively feasible to hitchhike
2018-09-25 02:32:17	+LambdaComplex	it's still......kinda feasible
2018-09-25 02:32:28	+LambdaComplex	one of my friends hitchhiked from NC to Vegas a few years ago
2018-09-25 02:32:29	+brooks	cross country?
2018-09-25 02:32:31	+brooks	nice
2018-09-25 02:32:39	+LambdaComplex	took him ~2 weeks iirc
2018-09-25 02:32:47	+brooks	there are a lot of laws that get in the way now
2018-09-25 02:33:17	+LambdaComplex	spoiler alert: no there aren't
2018-09-25 02:33:19	+LambdaComplex	people just think there are
2018-09-25 02:33:35	+brooks	not what I mean
2018-09-25 02:33:44	+brooks	there are laws about what spots you can use for hitchhiking
2018-09-25 02:34:14	 *	LambdaComplex is looking things up
2018-09-25 02:34:27	+LambdaComplex	>standing at the on-ramp entrance before a highway is legal in most states.
2018-09-25 02:34:40	+LambdaComplex	hmmmmmm
2018-09-25 02:34:49	+LambdaComplex	>It’s illegal to stand on the side of a major highway and solicit rides, because this is a danger to other drivers on the road.
2018-09-25 02:35:05	+LambdaComplex	but what about walking down the side of a major highway without soliciting rides?
2018-09-25 02:35:13	+brooks	> The real danger of hitchhiking has most likely remained relatively constant, but the general perception of this danger has increased. ... [O]ur national tolerance for danger has gone down: things that we previously saw as reasonably safe suddenly appeared imminently threatening. This trend is not just isolated to the world of hitchhiking; it has become a pernicious artifact throughout the
2018-09-25 02:35:16	+brooks	American cultural conscience. 
2018-09-25 02:35:37	+LambdaComplex	sounds right
2018-09-25 02:35:50	+brooks	> Today, hitchhiking is legal in 44 of the 50 states,[25][26] provided that the hitchhiker is not standing in the roadway or otherwise hindering the normal flow of traffic. Even in states where hitchhiking is illegal, hitchhikers are rarely ticketed. For example, the Wyoming Highway Patrol approached 524 hitchhikers in 2010, but only eight of them were cited (hitchhiking was subsequently legalized
2018-09-25 02:35:53	+brooks	in Wyoming in 2013).
2018-09-25 02:36:07	+LambdaComplex	i saw a person walking down the side of US-1 earlier this year and considered picking them up but decided against it
2018-09-25 02:36:11	+brooks	cool
2018-09-25 02:36:13	+LambdaComplex	i felt bad about it afterwards :(
2018-09-25 02:36:17	+brooks	time to start hitchhiking
2018-09-25 02:36:23	+LambdaComplex	so then i vowed i'd pick up the next hitchhiker i saw
2018-09-25 02:36:28	+LambdaComplex	...i haven't seen any since then
2018-09-25 02:36:32	+brooks	sounds about right
2018-09-25 02:36:52	+LambdaComplex	i'm only stopping if they have a big backpack though
2018-09-25 02:37:01	+brooks	last opportunity I noticed to give someone a ride (I wasn't driving) was almost a year ago now

2018-09-25 03:04:11	+winny	:3
2018-09-25 03:04:14	+winny	ok nm u pass
2018-09-25 03:04:17	+brooks	js is surprisingly nice in certain ways pretty much by accident
2018-09-25 03:04:40	+brooks	well less by accident and more in spite of terrible decisions
2018-09-25 03:04:54	+brooks	it's based on a smalltalk called SELF, but u probably know that

2018-09-25 04:29:29	+naught0	welcome to hexchat
2018-09-25 04:30:03	+brooks	you should be able to add an apt sources file and do apt update && apt install weechat
2018-09-25 04:31:29	+naught0	the debian is so horribly out of date
2018-09-25 04:31:33	+naught0	all the deps are outta date too
2018-09-25 04:32:20	+brooks	that's what the apt sources file is for
2018-09-25 04:32:27	+brooks	it gives you an updated link to the build
2018-09-25 04:32:45	+brooks	https://weechat.org/download/debian/
2018-09-25 04:35:09	+naught0	hmmmm
2018-09-25 04:35:11	+naught0	I was just there
2018-09-25 04:35:53	+naught0	I always use arch so it's weird to be using apt
2018-09-25 04:36:05	+naught0	I tried dpkg -i on the deb but it failed
2018-09-25 04:36:13	+naught0	sudo apt install -f after that didn't do anything :<
2018-09-25 04:37:52	+brooks	instead of downloading the deb, make a file called /etc/apt/sources.list.d/weechat.list and put the weechat repo in it
2018-09-25 04:38:00	+naught0	:o
2018-09-25 04:38:03	+brooks	it'll install the latest version and its deps

2018-09-25 04:38:26	+brooks	I'm tryna level up my linux skills lately
2018-09-25 04:41:47	+brooks	wh-what syslogger should I use
2018-09-25 04:49:33	+naught0	no idea :3
2018-09-25 04:53:41	+naught0	doesn't systemd act as a syslogger with like journalctl and stuff
2018-09-25 04:54:10	+brooks	oh, yeah
2018-09-25 04:54:13	+brooks	I don't use systemd tho
2018-09-25 04:54:27	+naught0	oh no not you too 
2018-09-25 04:54:39	+brooks	I'm not a fanatic
2018-09-25 04:55:11	+brooks	systemd isn't bad software, I don't really care about that, but it is dangerous and it's not difficult to understand why if you study a little history
2018-09-25 04:55:34	+naught0	no idea about the history, all I know is it works and it doesn't not work
2018-09-25 04:55:39	+naught0	what's the scary history
2018-09-25 04:56:23	+naught0	actually that's probably a really long-winded answer that has already been answered elsewhere. If you wanna link me somewhere to learn the error of my ways I'd be glad 2 read :3
2018-09-25 04:56:35	+brooks	honestly I don't know what I could link
2018-09-25 04:56:51	+brooks	it's kind of strange
2018-09-25 04:56:57	+naught0	is it because it's "monolithic" or smth
2018-09-25 04:57:12	+brooks	I can tell you a couple things and link some stuff that would let you explore what I'm getting at, I think
2018-09-25 04:57:29	+brooks	so you know other init systems?
2018-09-25 04:58:20	+naught0	n-not really :<
2018-09-25 04:58:28	+brooks	okay
2018-09-25 04:58:56	+brooks	I'm not really very familiar with the other init systems, like sysvinit and such, but they were the norm for a long time
2018-09-25 04:59:17	+brooks	but there's a set of alternatives to init systems called supervisor suites
2018-09-25 04:59:29	+brooks	runit, s6, openrc, etc
2018-09-25 04:59:42	+brooks	these are inheritors of another supervisor suite called daemon-tools
2018-09-25 05:00:03	+brooks	...I think
2018-09-25 05:00:10	+brooks	daemontools*
2018-09-25 05:00:16	<--	naniwa (uid311599@I.want.to.because.you.think.I.cant) has quit
2018-09-25 05:00:53	+brooks	daemontools was written way back in 2001, because problems with traditional initsystems were apparent
2018-09-25 05:01:18	+brooks	already apparent
2018-09-25 05:01:28	+brooks	systemd is a successor to the other model, the one that there were already reactions to nearly 20 years ago
2018-09-25 05:02:16	+naught0	I never really knew what went on back in the day when I installed ubuntu in the 5th grade 
2018-09-25 05:02:23	+naught0	but systemd probably wasn't around as default then yeah?
2018-09-25 05:02:27	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-25 05:02:38	+brooks	systemd has been getting popular, not because of its superiority or anything like that, but because of politics
2018-09-25 05:02:44	+brooks	and that fact alone is scary
2018-09-25 05:02:50	+brooks	but the other thing to note here is like
2018-09-25 05:02:57	+brooks	it's not getting popular *among users*
2018-09-25 05:03:04	+brooks	it's getting popular among *distro maintainers*
2018-09-25 05:03:17	+brooks	and us peasants just get stuck with it
2018-09-25 05:03:38	+brooks	and that makes the politics of it even more concerning
2018-09-25 05:04:50	+brooks	what we've ended up with is a pretty heavy-handed replacement for something most people never needed to care about in the first place
2018-09-25 05:05:23	+brooks	and so there's a group of people trying to push back on that, but since no one ever needed to care before, it makes no sense to anyone who isn't among that group who already knew why they should care
2018-09-25 05:05:33	+naught0	but I mean, systems like ubuntu are built to be user-friendly which means that the developers / maintainers have to make decisions like this right
2018-09-25 05:05:47	+naught0	I can get some uproar with Arch or something
2018-09-25 05:06:13	+brooks	it's debatable whether systemd is userfriendly, but even if it is that isn't why it was chosen
2018-09-25 05:06:28	+naught0	systemd doesn't have to be userfriendly to ship
2018-09-25 05:06:37	+brooks	it actually makes more sense to me for arch to be shipping it than ubuntu
2018-09-25 05:07:13	+brooks	arch is very explicitly a "we care about the ease of building, maintaining, and shipping this distro more than we care about the experience of using it, and that will always be our priority"
2018-09-25 05:07:19	+brooks	systemd makes sense from a distro dev perspective
2018-09-25 05:07:34	+brooks	but look at debian
2018-09-25 05:07:46	+brooks	why's debian shipping it
2018-09-25 05:08:01	+naught0	I mean, the maintainers of Ubuntu make decisions to ship their distro with certain defaults. If they want that default for their users, who typically aren't the arch-types let's say, then why not
2018-09-25 05:08:17	+naught0	Why not tho
2018-09-25 05:08:21	+naught0	Why is something else better
2018-09-25 05:08:30	+brooks	the initial vote about which system to ship with debian actually didn't involve a series of discussions comparing systems
2018-09-25 05:08:42	+brooks	it actually involved a very short list and a vote was forced
2018-09-25 05:09:39	+brooks	that's the thing right, systemd is already normal, so we're past the point of debating whether to adopt it in favor of something else. it won, now the discussion is "why would we use something else"
2018-09-25 05:09:40	+naught0	so what is the main worry, aside from user-friendliness and politics?
2018-09-25 05:10:11	+brooks	that last part is backward, it suggests I oppose it for political reasons, but it's the other way around. it was chosen for political reasons and now I have to care about politics
2018-09-25 05:10:19	+naught0	are they stealing your data? does it make the system insecure?
2018-09-25 05:10:28	+brooks	no, and yes
2018-09-25 05:10:33	+naught0	how's that
2018-09-25 05:11:11	+brooks	one of the security advantages of linux was always that you could only target a few sets of software and even then there was so much diversity that vulnerabilities that affected most of the population were unlikely
2018-09-25 05:11:19	+brooks	systemd is another piece now, and its attack surface is huge
2018-09-25 05:11:28	+brooks	it's basically universal
2018-09-25 05:11:43	+brooks	so on security principles alone, it was already a bad idea for it to be in the position it's in
2018-09-25 05:12:38	+naught0	so because it's so ubiquitous, it's easier to devise ways to make exploits yeah?
2018-09-25 05:12:52	+naught0	I guess that does make sense
2018-09-25 05:12:56	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-25 05:13:01	+brooks	but that's not the main objection
2018-09-25 05:13:09	+naught0	That should be the main objection imho :3
2018-09-25 05:13:12	+brooks	what I'm getting at here by mentioning all this stuff that seems extraneous
2018-09-25 05:13:49	+brooks	is that systemd is now the status quo, and arguing against its adoption would have been easier than arguing to change it now
2018-09-25 05:14:12	+naught0	how hard is it to change your init system
2018-09-25 05:14:20	+brooks	very
2018-09-25 05:14:29	+brooks	before systemd, it wasn't
2018-09-25 05:14:31	+naught0	a lot of stuff depends on it?
2018-09-25 05:14:34	+brooks	but systemd is making it difficult
2018-09-25 05:14:47	+brooks	a lot of things now depend on it, distros are built around it
2018-09-25 05:15:14	+brooks	udev, GNOME, and...more stuff I can't remember right now
2018-09-25 05:15:21	+brooks	depend on systemd
2018-09-25 05:15:22	+naught0	oh wow
2018-09-25 05:15:29	+naught0	That's kind of shit
2018-09-25 05:15:32	+brooks	yes
2018-09-25 05:15:35	+brooks	yes it is
2018-09-25 05:15:37	+brooks	and so you can see
2018-09-25 05:15:43	+naught0	I finally understand lol ty
2018-09-25 05:15:45	+brooks	it's not that systemd is bad software, exactly
2018-09-25 05:15:51	+brooks	this is the politics of it
2018-09-25 05:15:55	+naught0	I am now part of the brigade
2018-09-25 05:15:56	+brooks	there are effects of its adoption
2018-09-25 05:16:11	+brooks	but
2018-09-25 05:16:15	+brooks	leaving aside all of that:
2018-09-25 05:16:25	+brooks	supervisor suites are really fascinating!
2018-09-25 05:16:30	+naught0	what is that
2018-09-25 05:16:41	+brooks	you can think of them as a different kind of init system
2018-09-25 05:16:42	+naught0	boy I sure wish I could have informed conversations about things with u lol
2018-09-25 05:16:56	+naught0	how is it different
2018-09-25 05:17:05	+brooks	they supervise your daemons like an init system does, but they do it differently
2018-09-25 05:17:39	+brooks	https://www.skarnet.org/software/s6/why.html this gets into some of it, but it's hard to follow if you don't already know about the things it's arguing for and against
2018-09-25 05:17:49	+brooks	I spent a while on this site one day and it was neat
2018-09-25 05:18:13	+brooks	also!
2018-09-25 05:18:16	+brooks	I'm far from an expert
2018-09-25 05:18:50	+winny	the only good supervisor is systemd JK JK
2018-09-25 05:18:52	+brooks	I don't have much experience at all, I just read some stuff
2018-09-25 05:19:51	+naught0	yeah but at least you know what an init system is :3
2018-09-25 05:19:58	+brooks	sorta!
2018-09-25 05:20:06	+brooks	it's pretty vague
2018-09-25 05:20:10	+brooks	2 me
2018-09-25 05:20:38	+winny	tbh idk any init systems other than freebsd's, systemd, openrc, and sysv init
2018-09-25 05:21:00	+winny	i know there is launchd and smf which are xml gay memems
2018-09-25 05:21:20	+brooks	check out runit and s6 maybe
2018-09-25 05:21:28	+winny	heard of that too
2018-09-25 05:21:42	+winny	but i don't know what differentiates it from say sysv init
2018-09-25 05:23:33	+brooks	if I remember right
2018-09-25 05:24:01	+brooks	supervisor suites separate out logging in such a way as to ensure that even if the init system dies, you can still get logs of your system failure
2018-09-25 05:24:09	+brooks	as long as you set that all up right
2018-09-25 05:24:26	+brooks	they're also more like, a suite of tools and daemons
2018-09-25 05:24:29	+brooks	rather than a single system
2018-09-25 05:24:57	+brooks	with the logging advantage being a big perk of that, but there are probably more
2018-09-25 05:25:08	+brooks	s6 in particular doesn't use polling, which is neat as hell
2018-09-25 05:25:53	+brooks	naught0: if u want to know my secret, it's just being really meta and critical-- but like in the old sense, not the dumb 'cynical' sense
2018-09-25 05:31:44	+brooks	also having friends who know more than me
2018-09-25 05:32:02	+naught0	that's where u come in 
2018-09-25 05:32:20	+naught0	:3
2018-09-25 05:34:45	+brooks	wait I think openrc is actually an init system, not a supervisor suite
2018-09-25 05:34:50	+brooks	oops

2018-09-25 12:41:28	+LambdaComplex	[ x"$server" = x ];
2018-09-25 12:41:31	+LambdaComplex	that's a neat construct
2018-09-25 12:41:33	+LambdaComplex	i guess
2018-09-25 12:41:52	+Kirjava	I should probably like
2018-09-25 12:41:54	+Kirjava	learn bash
2018-09-25 12:41:57	+Kirjava	at some poinmt
2018-09-25 12:42:00	+LambdaComplex	probably
2018-09-25 12:42:13	+Kirjava	I can do cd and ls
2018-09-25 12:42:17	+LambdaComplex	actually nevermind i don't get it
2018-09-25 12:42:17	+Kirjava	and man
2018-09-25 12:42:24	+LambdaComplex	why not just [ "$server" = "" ]
2018-09-25 12:42:30	+LambdaComplex	brooks: PLEASE EXPLAIN
2018-09-25 12:42:35	+brooks	I have no idea 
2018-09-25 12:42:40	+LambdaComplex	dysfigured: PLEASE EXPLAIN
2018-09-25 12:43:01	+brooks	Kirjava: do it! #code can help
2018-09-25 12:43:25	+brooks	Kirjava: first thing you need to know, everything is a string
2018-09-25 12:43:44	+LambdaComplex	yes, even the numbers
2018-09-25 12:44:09	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: second thing: always quote your variable expansions
2018-09-25 12:44:11	+LambdaComplex	$bad
2018-09-25 12:44:13	+LambdaComplex	"$good"
2018-09-25 12:44:56	+brooks	yep, since everything is a string, variables can get expanded into multiple words and fuck up the string you intended 
2018-09-25 12:45:13	+LambdaComplex	(zsh won't do that, but that's none of my business)
2018-09-25 12:45:26	+brooks	wait really 
2018-09-25 12:45:27	+Kirjava	I use zsh
2018-09-25 12:45:41	+Kirjava	 the extent of my bash-fu is knowing a bunch of commands and being able to pipe
2018-09-25 12:45:44	+Kirjava	that's all I can do
2018-09-25 12:45:56	+Kirjava	and to be honest that's all i've needed so far
2018-09-25 12:46:00	+Kirjava	...why should I learn bash again
2018-09-25 12:46:13	+brooks	it's a tool for thought 
2018-09-25 12:46:26	+LambdaComplex	> countargs() { echo "${#@}" }
2018-09-25 12:46:30	+brooks	you won't know when you need it if you don't know it in the first place
2018-09-25 12:46:34	+LambdaComplex	> foo="bar baz"
2018-09-25 12:46:36	+bdelloid	why am I still alive
2018-09-25 12:46:37	+Kirjava	that's a good point
2018-09-25 12:46:38	+bdelloid	reeee
2018-09-25 12:46:39	+LambdaComplex	> countargs $foo
2018-09-25 12:46:42	+LambdaComplex	1
2018-09-25 12:46:49	+Kirjava	and there have definitely been points when I've been like
2018-09-25 12:46:54	+Kirjava	"man I wish I was better at bash"
2018-09-25 12:47:02	+LambdaComplex	brooks: t i a s
2018-09-25 12:47:04	+Kirjava	bdelloid: stay with us I need you
2018-09-25 12:47:49	+brooks	bdelloid: I prefer you alive
2018-09-25 12:48:22	+bdelloid	brooks, I don't
2018-09-25 12:48:34	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: why not
2018-09-25 12:48:34	+bdelloid	:(
2018-09-25 12:48:43	+bdelloid	I just feel like I need to die
2018-09-25 12:49:00	+brooks	bdelloid: let's do a buddy cop movie, you can teach me to write good code and be the surly one and we'll alienate audiences everywhere because I won't make any sense as a naive and plucky newcomer
2018-09-25 12:49:08	+LambdaComplex	do you want to die? or do you want to not live?
2018-09-25 12:49:19	+LambdaComplex	brooks: can there be a B plot about me trying to write rust
2018-09-25 12:49:32	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, no, I need to die
2018-09-25 12:49:35	+brooks	yes, but you die needlessly to advance the plot 
2018-09-25 12:49:37	+bdelloid	I don't want to die nor live, but I need to die
2018-09-25 12:49:48	+LambdaComplex	why do you need to die?
2018-09-25 12:50:13	+bdelloid	I don't know, I just need to
2018-09-25 12:51:10	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-25 12:51:20	+LambdaComplex	possibly related question: why do you hate new years eve so much?
2018-09-25 12:51:47	+bdelloid	because it signifies change and hope, which I lack
2018-09-25 12:52:16	+Kirjava	but how else are we supposed to make beautiful rust together
2018-09-25 12:52:28	+LambdaComplex	you really don't strike me as the type of person to care about arbitrary things like when the calendar ends
2018-09-25 12:52:53	+bdelloid	Kirjava, I just need to find my replacement
2018-09-25 12:52:59	+bdelloid	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
2018-09-25 12:53:11	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, yeah, but NYE is when I tried to kill myself, twice
2018-09-25 12:53:23	+bdelloid	it's a tradition at this point
2018-09-25 12:54:31	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid you have to give me your gf's number before you do it so that i can call her and we can talk about you
2018-09-25 12:54:35	+LambdaComplex	it'll help me grieve!!
2018-09-25 12:55:13	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, sure, it's 555-SHES-NOT-REAL
2018-09-25 12:56:24	+LambdaComplex	have you been making her up this whole time??
2018-09-25 12:57:58	+bdelloid	yeah
2018-09-25 12:59:02	+LambdaComplex	cool, then she can be whatever you want!
2018-09-25 12:59:10	+LambdaComplex	i bet she's the perfect support for you
2018-09-25 12:59:12	+LambdaComplex	<3
2018-09-25 12:59:38	+bdelloid	no, she's awful
2018-09-25 12:59:50	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-25 13:00:05	+Kirjava	what are the chances
2018-09-25 13:02:21	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: can you be bdelloid's girlfriend?
2018-09-25 13:02:30	+bdelloid	gay
2018-09-25 13:05:22	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava is so sweet though!
2018-09-25 13:05:25	+LambdaComplex	you'd be great together
2018-09-25 13:05:32	+LambdaComplex	(cute |bdelloid and Kirjava|)

2018-09-25 13:06:31	+Kirjava	bdelloid: wow I didn't know you were gay
2018-09-25 13:07:09	+bdelloid	I'M NOT GAY
2018-09-25 13:07:10	+bdelloid	REEEEEEEE
2018-09-25 13:07:21	+bdelloid	fuck this gay earth
2018-09-25 13:07:26	+bdelloid	I'm gonna smoke weed and eat a parfait

2018-09-25 13:07:42	+bdelloid	I'm so cool and edgy
2018-09-25 13:07:48	+bdelloid	but also sweet and french
2018-09-25 13:07:53	+brooks	that actually sounds awesome
2018-09-25 13:08:11	+bdelloid	never be french tho
2018-09-25 13:09:26	+brooks	why not
2018-09-25 13:09:39	+bdelloid	french people are terrible
2018-09-25 13:18:01	+Kirjava	next season of the good place is out on friday
2018-09-25 13:18:10	+Kirjava	hyype

2018-09-25 13:19:45	+LambdaComplex	HAHA HE GOT A FREE CHURRO!!!!
2018-09-25 13:22:40	+Kirjava	worst episode 4/10
2018-09-25 13:22:56	+Kirjava	preferred the underwater one
2018-09-25 13:25:04	+LambdaComplex	knock once if you have good taste
2018-09-25 13:25:57	 *	brooks knocks shave and a haircut
2018-09-25 13:26:19	+Kirjava	what does it matter if I have good taste or not - the person's opinion that affects my ability to enjoy a show is my own
2018-09-25 13:26:29	+Kirjava	the people that eat poop to get off don't care if u find it weird
2018-09-25 13:26:53	+Kirjava	unless they're only getting off BECAUSE you find it weird
2018-09-25 13:26:58	+Kirjava	which is probably likely actually
2018-09-25 13:27:00	+Kirjava	bad example
2018-09-25 13:28:57	+Kirjava	js> 'ß' === 'ß'.toUpperCase().toLowerCase()

2018-09-25 13:31:51	+LambdaComplex	were the nazis german?
2018-09-25 13:34:04	+brooks	tfw my screen keeps blinding me
2018-09-25 13:34:11	+brooks	tfw brightness is on lowest setting
2018-09-25 13:34:17	+Kirjava	LambdaComplex: dont think so
2018-09-25 13:34:20	+LambdaComplex	did you try wearing sunglasses
2018-09-25 13:34:34	+trinary	xrandr --output eDP1 --brightness 0.1
2018-09-25 13:40:21	+brooks	good point
2018-09-25 13:40:24	+brooks	thanks
2018-09-25 13:43:39	+LambdaComplex	fun fact: bojack horseman only uses the word "fuck" once per season
2018-09-25 13:43:52	+LambdaComplex	and each time, it indicates a relationship being damaged horribly
2018-09-25 13:50:35	+LambdaComplex	...maybe that's not actually "fun"
2018-09-25 13:51:11	+brooks	i like the funny horse cartoon
2018-09-25 13:52:32	+brooks	how should I customize my tty output #code
2018-09-25 13:53:09	+LambdaComplex	brooks: /etc/issue
2018-09-25 13:53:12	+LambdaComplex	:^3
2018-09-25 13:53:12	+bdelloid	raaaaaaa
2018-09-25 13:53:14	+bdelloid	aaaaa
2018-09-25 13:53:17	+LambdaComplex	wait that wasn't a shitpost
2018-09-25 13:53:18	+bdelloid	I'm going to eat a parfait now
2018-09-25 13:53:30	+brooks	nice
2018-09-25 13:53:36	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, shut up, I'm watching that
2018-09-25 13:53:52	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: bojack horseman?
2018-09-25 13:53:58	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, yes
2018-09-25 13:54:00	+brooks	LambdaComplex: I mean "in what ways should I customize it" not "how can I"!
2018-09-25 13:54:06	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-25 13:54:11	+LambdaComplex	brooks: make your /etc/issue look cool
2018-09-25 13:54:24	+LambdaComplex	brooks: oh, and install gdm
2018-09-25 13:54:32	+LambdaComplex	so that you have a mouse cursor in your tty
2018-09-25 13:54:41	+brooks	delete this
2018-09-25 13:54:47	+LambdaComplex	i think that's what it's called at least
2018-09-25 13:55:00	+LambdaComplex	sorry, gpm
2018-09-25 13:55:12	+Kirjava	how often do you work on your computer without using X
2018-09-25 13:55:20	+bdelloid	all the time
2018-09-25 13:55:32	+brooks	a few times a week I guess
2018-09-25 13:55:37	+LambdaComplex	brooks: also always split your screen with tmux and run cmatrix on one side
2018-09-25 13:55:40	+LambdaComplex	that's very important
2018-09-25 13:55:41	+Kirjava	wtf are you people doing
2018-09-25 13:56:04	+Kirjava	do you just use weebchat and vim or something
2018-09-25 13:56:07	+bdelloid	Kirjava, hacking the gibson
2018-09-25 13:56:12	+Kirjava	but of course
2018-09-25 13:58:17	+brooks	I just don't start X if I'm working on certain things
2018-09-25 13:58:24	+bdelloid	yeah
2018-09-25 13:59:02	+brooks	like e.g. I just compiled my kernel, but it didn't work the way I had in mind, why start X to fix it
2018-09-25 13:59:08	+Kirjava	oh yeah sure
2018-09-25 13:59:17	+brooks	today I'm going to fix my initramfs
2018-09-25 13:59:31	+Kirjava	but it's not often in the NORMAL course of things I can go without X
2018-09-25 13:59:48	+brooks	this is the normal course of things for me now ig
2018-09-25 13:59:53	+Kirjava	maybe that's different for you lot because you always ricing
2018-09-25 14:00:04	+brooks	I don't rice!
2018-09-25 14:00:15	+Kirjava	I dont habeeb you
2018-09-25 14:00:18	+brooks	well I guess I'm ricing my tty right now, but that's abnormal
2018-09-25 14:00:29	+LambdaComplex	haha hey brooks remember when you didn't talk about politics every day?
2018-09-25 14:00:31	+LambdaComplex	i don't :^)
2018-09-25 14:00:40	+brooks	I do
2018-09-25 14:00:44	+LambdaComplex	i know
2018-09-25 14:00:45	+brooks	I also remember when I first started
2018-09-25 14:01:01	+Kirjava	politics is boring and sad making
2018-09-25 14:01:04	+brooks	"idk why I'm talking about politics so much lately, I'm not always like this. I'm sure it's just a phase"
2018-09-25 14:01:07	+brooks	>several years later
2018-09-25 14:01:34	+LambdaComplex	08:55 <+brooks> this is the normal course of things for me now ig
2018-09-25 14:01:36	+LambdaComplex	:^3
2018-09-25 14:01:49	+brooks	I use the word politics in a more expansive way than I think you mean
2018-09-25 14:02:21	+LambdaComplex	brooks have you noticed what my vhost is lately
2018-09-25 14:02:24	+LambdaComplex	jw
2018-09-25 14:02:29	+LambdaComplex	(i made it better!)
2018-09-25 14:02:32	+brooks	I did notice that
2018-09-25 14:02:38	+LambdaComplex	:D
2018-09-25 14:02:40	+LambdaComplex	(cute brooks)
2018-09-25 14:02:41	+meep	( ´・‿-) ~ ♥ b​rooks
2018-09-25 14:02:52	+brooks	it's a good vhost
2018-09-25 14:03:08	+brooks	wait, made it better, you mean by capitalizing it?
2018-09-25 14:03:24	+LambdaComplex	yes
2018-09-25 14:03:28	+brooks	nice
2018-09-25 14:03:51	+brooks	hey wait where are the .....sequences? in /etc/issue documented
2018-09-25 14:04:07	+brooks	man 5 issue doesn't explain it 
2018-09-25 14:04:21	+brooks	oh never mind
2018-09-25 14:04:26	+brooks	it does point me in the right direction
2018-09-25 14:04:48	+LambdaComplex	yes it does
2018-09-25 14:05:07	+Kirjava	what are the numbers for in man pages
2018-09-25 14:05:32	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: man man
2018-09-25 14:05:43	+brooks	Kirjava: "The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain."
2018-09-25 14:05:53	+brooks	they're categories
2018-09-25 14:05:54	+Kirjava	oh man
2018-09-25 14:06:04	+Kirjava	they have a category for games
2018-09-25 14:06:12	+Kirjava	I can only assume that's for futureproofing
2018-09-25 14:06:34	+brooks	this is one of the more straightforward ways to level up linux skills pretty quickly
2018-09-25 14:06:43	+LambdaComplex	spoiler alert: you probably have a /var/games dir
2018-09-25 14:06:46	+brooks	by learning to navigate man pages and making a habit of it
2018-09-25 14:06:52	+Kirjava	is it for tuxracer
2018-09-25 14:07:01	+Kirjava	yea I started getting into man recently
2018-09-25 14:07:03	+LambdaComplex	idk tbh
2018-09-25 14:07:13	+Kirjava	I autogenerated a manpage with help2man
2018-09-25 14:07:15	+LambdaComplex	i know there's a "games" thing when you install openbsd
2018-09-25 14:07:16	+Kirjava	...then looked at the source
2018-09-25 14:07:20	+Kirjava	and was like
2018-09-25 14:07:23	+LambdaComplex	along with stuff like x11 support
2018-09-25 14:07:24	+Kirjava	fuck writing a man page by hand
2018-09-25 14:07:26	+brooks	oh yeah
2018-09-25 14:07:29	+brooks	fuck allll that
2018-09-25 14:07:34	+LambdaComplex	yeah just write markdown and use pandoc
2018-09-25 14:07:46	+LambdaComplex	>2018
2018-09-25 14:07:48	+LambdaComplex	>writing groff
2018-09-25 14:07:50	+LambdaComplex	nothx
2018-09-25 14:07:51	+Kirjava	TIL pandoc
2018-09-25 14:08:25	+Kirjava	will play w/ that 2nt
2018-09-25 14:08:27	+brooks	I've been using manuals for years, but I only recently started to care about the numbers
2018-09-25 14:08:28	+LambdaComplex	reminder that openbsd and freebsd man pages are great
2018-09-25 14:08:39	+brooks	I've heard that
2018-09-25 14:09:00	+brooks	also, there's an ISSUE ESCAPES section in the agetty manual
2018-09-25 14:09:14	+LambdaComplex	"hm, my network interfaces are em0-3. i'd like to get some info on that driver. i'll just check the em(4) man page"
2018-09-25 14:09:15	+Kirjava	uh oh
2018-09-25 14:09:18	+LambdaComplex	http://man.openbsd.org/em.4
2018-09-25 14:09:19	+Kirjava	the build is broken
2018-09-25 14:09:22	 *	Kirjava slightly panics
2018-09-25 14:09:33	+Kirjava	it's an issue with javascript dependencies
2018-09-25 14:09:35	+Kirjava	D:
2018-09-25 14:09:39	+LambdaComplex	and it even lists known bugs with the driver

2018-09-25 14:10:14	+LambdaComplex	are you gonna link to that every time i post an http page
2018-09-25 14:10:17	+Kirjava	we already established that you should be using http and not https
2018-09-25 14:10:19	+brooks	possibly
2018-09-25 14:10:34	+LambdaComplex	the s stands for swiss (Cheese)
2018-09-25 14:10:37	+LambdaComplex	it's full of holes!!!!
2018-09-25 14:10:41	+Kirjava	^
2018-09-25 14:10:45	+LambdaComplex	no wait it stands for ssl
2018-09-25 14:10:48	+LambdaComplex	but that's not secure anymore
2018-09-25 14:10:56	+LambdaComplex	^^^^^^^^^^^(mostly) shitposting
2018-09-25 14:11:17	+LambdaComplex	i still need to put my openbsd router config on github
2018-09-25 14:11:18	+Kirjava	whelp it works locally....
2018-09-25 14:11:24	+brooks	welp
2018-09-25 14:11:25	+Kirjava	wtf webpack
2018-09-25 14:11:42	+brooks	welcome to real world dev
2018-09-25 14:11:55	+brooks	"it works on my machine" 
2018-09-25 14:12:27	+brooks	hey LambdaComplex is changing the kernel name a common practice
2018-09-25 14:14:04	+LambdaComplex	brooks: the filename?
2018-09-25 14:14:25	+LambdaComplex	possibly; especially if you're gonna be putting kernels from several distros in the same location
2018-09-25 14:14:33	+LambdaComplex	tfw arch doesn't care
2018-09-25 14:14:38	+LambdaComplex	doesn't put "arch" or a version in the name
2018-09-25 14:14:41	+LambdaComplex	just "vmlinuz"
2018-09-25 14:15:09	+brooks	nah I mean like in the output of uname -s
2018-09-25 14:15:20	+LambdaComplex	o
2018-09-25 14:15:29	+LambdaComplex	i've never heard of anyone doing it
2018-09-25 14:15:32	+LambdaComplex	why?
2018-09-25 14:16:16	+brooks	/etc/issue includes it for some reason
2018-09-25 14:16:29	+brooks	I'm wondering if it's actually useful somehow
2018-09-25 14:16:35	+Kirjava	what the facking fuck
2018-09-25 14:16:42	+Kirjava	build fails with npm but not yarn
2018-09-25 14:17:00	+brooks	I WARNED THIS WOULD HAPPEN
2018-09-25 14:17:04	 *	brooks puts on rms hat
2018-09-25 14:17:06	+Kirjava	that means the error doesn't even make sense
2018-09-25 14:17:19	 *	Kirjava quietly screams
2018-09-25 14:17:47	+Kirjava	ok lets try just updating everything
2018-09-25 14:17:57	+brooks	are you syncing the versions?
2018-09-25 14:18:17	+Kirjava	yes
2018-09-25 14:18:23	+brooks	STRANGE
2018-09-25 14:18:24	+Kirjava	there's a lockfile and everything
2018-09-25 14:18:37	+Kirjava	updated webpack to v4.20 huehue

2018-09-25 14:20:41	+Kirjava	stupid ass npm

2018-09-25 14:22:14	+LambdaComplex	there's a note in the uname(2) man page about nodename/domainname btw

2018-09-25 14:22:44	+gnu	:(
2018-09-25 14:24:17	+brooks	>On the other hand, the field nodename is meaningless: it gives the name of the present machine in some undefined network, but typically machines are  in  more  than  one network and have several names.  Moreover, the kernel has no way of knowing about such things, so it has to be told what to answer here.
2018-09-25 14:25:25	+Kirjava	ugh I need like a cheat sheet for this damn thing
2018-09-25 14:25:35	+Kirjava	I don't need to read 3 paragraphs explaining what a variable is
2018-09-25 14:25:51	+FreeFull	Kirjava: What thing?
2018-09-25 14:26:03	+Kirjava	bash
2018-09-25 14:26:19	+FreeFull	There's probably a million bash cheatsheets
2018-09-25 14:26:24	+FreeFull	I usually just peek at the manpage though
2018-09-25 14:26:37	+Kirjava	yeah i should probably google "bash cheatsheet" rather than "bash tutorial"
2018-09-25 14:26:40	+Kirjava	which
2018-09-25 14:26:41	+Kirjava	man bash
2018-09-25 14:26:42	+mitya	cheatsheet to do what is the real question
2018-09-25 14:26:43	+Kirjava	HEY GOOD IDEA
2018-09-25 14:26:49	+FreeFull	man bash

2018-09-25 14:27:13	+Kirjava	oh right man bash is actually pretty good
2018-09-25 14:27:17	+brooks	yeah

2018-09-25 14:28:41	+Kirjava	I'm glad I complained now :D
2018-09-25 14:28:44	+FreeFull	Pitfalls are definitely worth knowing about
2018-09-25 14:28:48	+Kirjava	thanks for the links friends
2018-09-25 14:28:48	+bdelloid	high all the time to keep you off my mind oooh ooooh
2018-09-25 14:28:49	+brooks	was about to highlight you to link exactly these LambdaComplex 
2018-09-25 14:28:58	+Kirjava	bdelloid: you listening to that song again :D
2018-09-25 14:29:00	+LambdaComplex	>No, you don't assign a variable by putting a $ in front of the variable name. This isn't perl. 
2018-09-25 14:29:02	+LambdaComplex	kek
2018-09-25 14:29:11	+brooks	but it should be!
2018-09-25 14:29:13	+LambdaComplex	>No, you can't put spaces around the = when assigning to a variable. This isn't C.
2018-09-25 14:29:14	+brooks	perl a best
2018-09-25 14:29:15	+LambdaComplex	kek
2018-09-25 14:29:16	+LambdaComplex	(also sadface)
2018-09-25 14:29:23	+Kirjava	it could be
2018-09-25 14:29:39	+brooks	LambdaComplex: how could everything be a string if you made assignments multiple strings! it makes no sense!
2018-09-25 14:30:05	+LambdaComplex	by writing a parser that doesn't suck
2018-09-25 14:30:11	+brooks	u got me there
2018-09-25 14:30:36	+Kirjava	im really in the mood for taco bell rn
2018-09-25 14:30:41	+brooks	ok my /etc/issue is \n (linux-\r) \d
2018-09-25 14:31:00	+brooks	this is still boring
2018-09-25 14:31:07	+brooks	but it's better than what I had before
2018-09-25 14:31:41	+brooks	taco bell good
2018-09-25 14:31:47	+trinary	You can have a pretty issue with toilet
2018-09-25 14:31:56	+trinary	Even with colors!
2018-09-25 14:32:00	+brooks	I also think uname -s probably includes the local version?
2018-09-25 14:32:27	+brooks	from General setup in the kernel
2018-09-25 14:32:35	+brooks	trinary: ayy

2018-09-25 14:33:47	+brooks	is this a nixOS thing?
2018-09-25 14:33:57	 *	Kirjava globs LambdaComplex
2018-09-25 14:34:12	 *	brooks globs LambdaC*
2018-09-25 14:34:31	+trinary	The surrounding module makes sure I never need to do this manually
2018-09-25 14:34:36	 *	LambdaComplex complains about how bash handles glob errors poorly compared to zsh
2018-09-25 14:34:41	+trinary	But it's not required, you can do the inside manually or script it
2018-09-25 14:34:48	+trinary	(Yes, NixOS)
2018-09-25 14:35:00	+brooks	this is funny/neat
2018-09-25 14:35:17	+trinary	This is an ugly module, don't judge the whole thing by it
2018-09-25 14:35:38	+brooks	oh thanks
2018-09-25 14:35:46	+brooks	I wasn't, but I appreciate it
2018-09-25 14:36:50	+brooks	I'm gonna get figlet and feed it my hostname
2018-09-25 14:37:47	+brooks	let's see
2018-09-25 14:38:13	+brooks	oh cool that's what you did
2018-09-25 14:38:16	+brooks	yeah I'm stealing this
2018-09-25 14:38:47	+Kirjava	trinary: which lolcat implementation do you use
2018-09-25 14:39:01	+Kirjava	the only fast one i found is written in C, but it adds padding to the output
2018-09-25 14:39:35	+Kirjava	everything else is written in python and shit so you can't really pipe vim through it

2018-09-25 15:01:28	+Kirjava	google chrome is turning into aol browser
2018-09-25 15:03:26	+Kirjava	additionally, it's a lot more lenient in what it allows
2018-09-25 15:03:32	+Kirjava	which initially sounds like a good idea

2018-09-25 15:04:07	+Kirjava	this doesn't tend to happen if you build for ff
2018-09-25 15:04:22	+Kirjava	because they care about le spec
2018-09-25 15:04:57	+brooks	firefox is the only friend we've got
2018-09-25 15:04:58	+LambdaComplex	THIS WEBSITE WORKS BEST ON GOOGLE CHROME

2018-09-25 15:05:10	+Kirjava	google is the worst offender of this

2018-09-25 15:05:14	+brooks	I cry
2018-09-25 15:05:26	+Kirjava	they imp[lemented youtube with webcomponents v0 spec
2018-09-25 15:05:32	+Kirjava	which only chrome has, and isn't the real spec
2018-09-25 15:05:39	+Kirjava	so it runs like shit on other browsers
2018-09-25 15:05:49	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-25 15:05:55	+brooks	this is what they do
2018-09-25 15:05:58	+brooks	like microsoft before them
2018-09-25 15:06:16	+LambdaComplex	"At least they aren't Oracle"
2018-09-25 15:06:17	+brooks	the web is luck, and it's not going to survive the age
2018-09-25 15:06:20	+LambdaComplex	is that a good motto
2018-09-25 15:06:23	+brooks	nope
2018-09-25 15:06:27	+LambdaComplex	i know
2018-09-25 15:06:31	+LambdaComplex	:(
2018-09-25 15:06:32	+brooks	the fact that it's lasted this long is a miracle
2018-09-25 15:06:43	+Kirjava	well there are other things killing the web, google isn't really the problem with that
2018-09-25 15:06:55	+LambdaComplex	w-well at least us haxx0rz will probably still figure it out
2018-09-25 15:06:55	+Kirjava	china has already started the fragmentation
2018-09-25 15:07:05	+LambdaComplex	we can be the plucky main characters in the cyberpunk dystopia novel
2018-09-25 15:07:14	+brooks	we already are
2018-09-25 15:07:20	+LambdaComplex	...i know
2018-09-25 15:07:21	+LambdaComplex	;-;
2018-09-25 15:07:35	+LambdaComplex	perhaps i should look into packet radio
2018-09-25 15:07:41	+Kirjava	it's ok I rek we still got a solid few years until it's completely ruined
2018-09-25 15:07:47	+LambdaComplex	just in case i ever need to say "fuck the fcc, i'm using packet radio"
2018-09-25 15:07:51	+Kirjava	as long as IRC and github works I'm pretty set tbh
2018-09-25 15:07:54	+LambdaComplex	"(with encryption)"

2018-09-25 15:08:16	+Kirjava	mew
2018-09-25 15:09:49	+brooks	no matter how long the long arm of the alliance might get, we'll just get ourselves a little further
2018-09-25 15:10:03	+Kirjava	LambdaComplex: lets write a varient of tor that doesn't deal with anonymity but prevents censorship still - it'll be fast because there are no oinions
2018-09-25 15:10:05	+Kirjava	*onions
2018-09-25 15:10:19	+LambdaComplex	so, IPFS?
2018-09-25 15:10:28	+Kirjava	no because that isn't something we made
2018-09-25 15:10:33	+bdelloid	Kirjava, that's called a proxy
2018-09-25 15:10:45	+brooks	https://www.opennic.org/
2018-09-25 15:10:57	+Kirjava	a proxy doesn't help if the original source is taken down
2018-09-25 15:12:12	+brooks	I fucking hate google
2018-09-25 15:12:34	+Kirjava	so, google do some crap stuff
2018-09-25 15:12:36	+brooks	I was promised our cyberpunk dystopia would have shadowrunners sabotaging the dragons
2018-09-25 15:12:38	+Kirjava	but also some food stuff
2018-09-25 15:12:41	+Kirjava	*good
2018-09-25 15:12:44	+Kirjava	probably food too

2018-09-25 15:17:05	+brooks	pretty much yeah
2018-09-25 15:17:13	+brooks	none of this really makes sense
2018-09-25 15:17:43	+brooks	if I can hack into your nuclear-weapon-connected super computer by dialing in, you done fucked up

2018-09-25 15:17:55	+Kirjava	why is it even connected to the civilian internet

2018-09-25 15:52:39	+Kirjava	wait.. it's not just sh?
2018-09-25 15:52:40	+LambdaComplex	brooks: can the parent lang be rust?
2018-09-25 15:52:43	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: no
2018-09-25 15:52:49	+Kirjava	no the parent lang must be HolyC
2018-09-25 15:52:50	+brooks	possibly
2018-09-25 15:52:53	+Kirjava	terry was right all along
2018-09-25 15:52:54	+brooks	rust probably isn't ready for this
2018-09-25 15:52:59	+Kirjava	brooks: rude
2018-09-25 15:53:04	+brooks	no I mean
2018-09-25 15:53:11	+Kirjava	RUUUDE
2018-09-25 15:53:19	+brooks	rust has several design goals directly aimed at exactly this kind of thing
2018-09-25 15:53:28	+brooks	but I'm not sure how far along it is in pulling that off
2018-09-25 15:53:54	+LambdaComplex	brooks: elaborate
2018-09-25 15:54:00	+brooks	uhhhhhhhh
2018-09-25 15:54:02	+LambdaComplex	t. Resident Rust Evangelist
2018-09-25 15:54:03	+brooks	their whole
2018-09-25 15:54:09	+brooks	split std lib into 3 tiers
2018-09-25 15:54:11	+brooks	thing
2018-09-25 15:54:12	+Kirjava	maybe it is fair enough, I mean there's already a full OS 
2018-09-25 15:54:16	+Kirjava	*far
2018-09-25 15:55:11	+LambdaComplex	>split std lib into 3 tiers
2018-09-25 15:55:37	+LambdaComplex	i-is that a thing
2018-09-25 15:55:40	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-25 15:55:55	+LambdaComplex	are you talking core vs the stdlib?
2018-09-25 15:56:05	+brooks	yeah, there was a third
2018-09-25 15:56:08	+brooks	what happened to that
2018-09-25 15:56:13	 *	LambdaComplex can't think of any
2018-09-25 15:56:18	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: rustfriend, help
2018-09-25 15:56:24	+brooks	I remember the rfc
2018-09-25 15:56:54	+brooks	wait
2018-09-25 15:56:58	 *	LambdaComplex waits
2018-09-25 15:57:06	+brooks	I think it's just, you can run it with core instead of stdlib, or you can run it even without core
2018-09-25 15:57:09	+brooks	and that's all 3
2018-09-25 15:57:31	+brooks	so there are both #![no_stdlib] and #![no_core]
2018-09-25 15:57:47	+LambdaComplex	>no_core
2018-09-25 15:57:50	+LambdaComplex	that sounds horrendous
2018-09-25 15:57:53	+Kirjava	are you thinking of crates.io as the third
2018-09-25 15:57:53	+brooks	but with core it's already suitable for this, I think
2018-09-25 15:57:56	+brooks	nah
2018-09-25 15:58:03	+brooks	it was a systems programming dealio
2018-09-25 15:58:06	+Kirjava	what's wrong with having things like #![no_std]
2018-09-25 15:58:12	+LambdaComplex	> Unlike #![no_std], no_core is a nightly-only feature that we may never stabilize2. #![no_core] is something that’s basically only to be used if you are libcore (or you are an alternate Rust stdlib/core implementation trying to emulate it).
2018-09-25 15:58:24	+brooks	nothing, I was thinking this wasn't ready
2018-09-25 15:59:03	+Kirjava	but uh.. why would this split between stdlib and core have any bearing on it not being sufficient on the task at hand
2018-09-25 16:00:08	+LambdaComplex	    // we can't really do much in this benighted hellhole of
2018-09-25 16:00:10	+LambdaComplex	    // an environment without bringing in more libraries.
2018-09-25 16:00:12	+LambdaComplex	kek
2018-09-25 16:00:28	+Kirjava	I've never actually used no_std
2018-09-25 16:00:44	+Kirjava	bcz I don't do any embedded or write operating systems
2018-09-25 16:01:25	+brooks	well I'm out of my depth, really, but what I'm thinking about is how C is the language of unix. there's a manual section for C library stuff and everything. the idea is that you have a universal language for building systems software, and then you have a shell as the user interface. but if you make the shell an internal DSL of an already expressive language that is itself the universal language of
2018-09-25 16:01:27	+brooks	its OS, you get something much more powerful automatically
2018-09-25 16:02:07	+brooks	this is cargo cult bullshit on my part, I don't understand this well enough to actually make this argument, but it's ~how it's done~
2018-09-25 16:02:19	+LambdaComplex	....so, HolyC and TempleOS
2018-09-25 16:02:22	+Kirjava	but would more power lead to it being harder to use?
2018-09-25 16:02:31	+brooks	nah
2018-09-25 16:02:41	+Kirjava	C is just as easy as bash?
2018-09-25 16:02:43	+brooks	it'd just be the shell unless you wanted it to not be
2018-09-25 16:02:51	+LambdaComplex	....so, HolyC and TempleOS
2018-09-25 16:02:54	+brooks	so you'd only need to worry about the parent language if you already needed it
2018-09-25 16:03:06	+brooks	and yeah, HolyC and TempleOS do exactly this
2018-09-25 16:03:11	+Kirjava	I don't know how redoxOS does this
2018-09-25 16:03:15	+Kirjava	maybe it does the same
2018-09-25 16:03:16	+LambdaComplex	RIP Terry
2018-09-25 16:03:18	+Kirjava	we should check!
2018-09-25 16:03:28	+Kirjava	because it'd be funny if it already was a thing
2018-09-25 16:03:45	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: https://github.com/redox-os/syscall
2018-09-25 16:03:49	+LambdaComplex	that, i guess?
2018-09-25 16:04:16	+Arathnim	This sounds like something I'd be interested in.
2018-09-25 16:04:27	+Arathnim	Also, morning.
2018-09-25 16:04:29	+Kirjava	looks like redox shell is a bash varient
2018-09-25 16:04:34	 *	LambdaComplex prepares to get lisp machines thrown at him
2018-09-25 16:04:41	+brooks	good morning Arathnim 
2018-09-25 16:04:48	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: but what libc (or equivalent) is it using??
2018-09-25 16:05:02	+Kirjava	dunno. I assume they are making their own
2018-09-25 16:05:29	+Arathnim	Oh, I've already written about that idea.
2018-09-25 16:05:44	+LambdaComplex	I just asked in #rust-offtopic 
2018-09-25 16:06:15	+Kirjava	found it
2018-09-25 16:06:16	+Kirjava	https://github.com/redox-os/relibc
2018-09-25 16:06:29	+brooks	I may have stolen it from you, not sure
2018-09-25 16:06:37	+Kirjava	it's a complete reimplementation
2018-09-25 16:07:21	+Arathnim	I don't think I could lift a lisp machine.
2018-09-25 16:07:35	+brooks	https://github.com/miselin/rfcs/blob/master/active/0000-freestanding-runtime.md not it
2018-09-25 16:07:37	+LambdaComplex	Just make a catapult
2018-09-25 16:07:38	+Arathnim	Much less throw it.
2018-09-25 16:07:38	+LambdaComplex	(with lisp)
2018-09-25 16:07:41	+brooks	but this is relevant
2018-09-25 16:08:28	+Kirjava	here's a version of tetris I wrote running on a lisp machine... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/4j2S8rm6/IMG_7964.JPG
2018-09-25 16:08:41	+brooks	jeez
2018-09-25 16:08:57	+brooks	I was excited about rust and defending it 4 years ago and I still haven't adopted it
2018-09-25 16:09:01	+brooks	feelsbad
2018-09-25 16:09:33	+Kirjava	you should
2018-09-25 16:09:41	+LambdaComplex	brooks: the best time to start is 4 years ago
2018-09-25 16:09:47	+LambdaComplex	brooks: the second-best time to start is today
2018-09-25 16:09:53	+FreeFull	Actually, I'd argue now is a better time to start
2018-09-25 16:09:59	+Kirjava	indeed
2018-09-25 16:10:07	+FreeFull	Rust 4 years ago wasn't the same Rust that it is now
2018-09-25 16:10:23	+Kirjava	rust ecosystem 4 years ago was like javascript ecosystem 2 years ago
2018-09-25 16:10:27	+FreeFull	Although, if you did start 4 years ago, like me, then you're pretty familiar with everything
2018-09-25 16:10:39	+Kirjava	I noticed that old rust had the 'int' type 
2018-09-25 16:10:40	+Kirjava	like wtf
2018-09-25 16:10:48	+Kirjava	and all sorts of wonky pointers
2018-09-25 16:10:48	+trinary	And ~[~Trait:]
2018-09-25 16:10:58	+brooks	https://github.com/pcwalton/zero.rs
2018-09-25 16:12:39	+brooks	I still can't find the rfc, but regardless it looks like what I'm referring to has been done for a long time
2018-09-25 16:13:03	+Kirjava	apology accepted
2018-09-25 16:14:09	+Kirjava	brooks: oh wait you were complaining that #
2018-09-25 16:14:15	+Kirjava	#[no_std] wasnt a thing?
2018-09-25 16:14:16	+Kirjava	or something
2018-09-25 16:14:33	+Kirjava	maybe I dont understand
2018-09-25 16:15:20	+FreeFull	Kirjava: int got renamed to isize
2018-09-25 16:15:38	+Kirjava	good because int is a really bad name
2018-09-25 16:16:01	+FreeFull	I started out with Rust 0.9, which still had int
2018-09-25 16:16:11	+brooks	oh, no, I was thinking "they were working on a system to facilitate the process of building an OS, first without [core], then implementing [core], then implementing the stdlib, but I don't know if they've finished it"
2018-09-25 16:16:15	+FreeFull	The ~[Foo] syntax was already phased out though, I think

2018-09-25 16:17:29	+trinary	Pod everywhere
2018-09-25 16:17:32	+Kirjava	Pod?
2018-09-25 16:18:01	+brooks	I'm remarkably bad at explaining things I only vaguely understand, so I imagine it's not just you
2018-09-25 16:18:13	+trinary	And ~"string"
2018-09-25 16:18:20	+brooks	I remember ~string
2018-09-25 16:18:25	+FreeFull	pod is the old name for Copy
2018-09-25 16:18:32	+FreeFull	"plain old data"
2018-09-25 16:18:32	+brooks	I also remember kori complaining about rust strings
2018-09-25 16:18:38	+Kirjava	you use a tilde when you think a string is cute
2018-09-25 16:18:50	+FreeFull	Copy used not to imply Clone too
2018-09-25 16:18:51	+Kirjava	FreeFull: wow that is terrible
2018-09-25 16:19:00	+Kirjava	both of those things
2018-09-25 16:19:05	+brooks	but I think most strings are cute
2018-09-25 16:19:07	+trinary	Looks so weird now
2018-09-25 16:19:39	+brooks	I was once able to defend the different strings
2018-09-25 16:20:07	+Kirjava	eh, the different strings are justified imo
2018-09-25 16:20:12	+Kirjava	like, entirely
2018-09-25 16:20:28	+brooks	oh no I mean "I can't remember what they are to talk about them anymore"
2018-09-25 16:20:32	+brooks	not "they suck now"
2018-09-25 16:20:43	+FreeFull	Oh yeah, and *const and *mut weren't a thing yet, it was just *
2018-09-25 16:20:57	+Kirjava	brooks: I can't imagined they've changed since then
2018-09-25 16:21:11	+Kirjava	there's String and &str and the Os versions of those 
2018-09-25 16:21:15	+brooks	I think they had stabilized by this point, but I don't remember either way
2018-09-25 16:22:52	+Kirjava	but yea jump in the water's lovely
2018-09-25 16:22:59	+trinary	Kirjava - And then there's Box<str>
2018-09-25 16:23:05	+brooks	im tryin
2018-09-25 16:23:23	+Kirjava	trinary: ...but why
2018-09-25 16:23:34	+Kirjava	how is it different to String
2018-09-25 16:23:40	+trinary	Not resizable
2018-09-25 16:23:46	+Kirjava	ah
2018-09-25 16:23:49	+trinary	Same reason you might want Box<[T]> over Vec<T>
2018-09-25 16:24:00	+Kirjava	yeah that makes sense
2018-09-25 16:24:26	+Kirjava	im p excited to get home and write some rust again

2018-09-25 16:30:46	+brooks	it should be possible/feasible to replace components of a C project with rust right? like e.g. replace a single .c file with a .rs file, and produce an .o file
2018-09-25 16:31:05	+brooks	this was an advertised thing for nim, but I never really saw the same thing referred to for rust
2018-09-25 16:31:13	+brooks	even though I'm pretty sure rust is perfectly capable of this

2018-09-25 16:41:02	+Kirjava	you have 0 seconds left
2018-09-25 16:41:11	+LambdaComplex	brooks: OsString/OsStr is a system string, so WTF8 (i think) on windows or utf8 (maybe) on *nix
2018-09-25 16:41:23	+LambdaComplex	(actually i think it's just bytes on *nix)
2018-09-25 16:41:46	+brooks	wtf is WTF8
2018-09-25 16:41:58	+Kirjava	there's also CString but you're a noob if you use CString ;-;
2018-09-25 16:42:16	+LambdaComplex	brooks: CString/CStr are....well, C strings. Arrays of non-nul characters terminated with a nul. You will never use these unless you're doing FFI

2018-09-25 16:43:49	+LambdaComplex	On Unix systems, strings are often arbitrary sequences of non-zero bytes, in many cases interpreted as UTF-8.

2018-09-25 17:10:59	+trinary	That is not a thing
2018-09-25 17:11:06	+Kirjava	a nybble?
2018-09-25 17:11:36	+trinary	And the size of usize is not important for this

2018-09-25 17:11:59	+Kirjava	*size of a byte
2018-09-25 17:12:17	+trinary	I thought we were past the days of byte != octet
2018-09-25 17:12:17	+brooks	where is the size of a bite assigned, exactly

2018-09-25 17:13:01	+brooks	I assumed it was strictly an abstraction, why does the hardware need to define the byte size?
2018-09-25 17:13:11	+Kirjava	address alignment
2018-09-25 17:13:27	+brooks	ah
2018-09-25 17:13:32	+Kirjava	you can't read from an address that isn't a multiple of the byte (or word on some processors)
2018-09-25 17:13:33	+trinary	A CPU gives you an instruction set
2018-09-25 17:13:45	+trinary	That instruction set defines what addresses are
2018-09-25 17:14:07	+brooks	that makes sense
2018-09-25 17:14:44	+Kirjava	I think non 8 bit bytes only exist on ancient machines now

2018-09-25 17:21:13	+Kirjava	I'm trying to work out *why* reading from unaligned addresses is an issue, but I can only assume it's some deep hardware thing I don't understand

2018-09-25 17:21:36	+Kirjava	I know you can emulate HW and allow it to work with unaligned addresses
2018-09-25 17:21:53	+Kirjava	so it must be for some performance or physical design consideration or something
2018-09-25 17:22:00	+brooks	LambdaComplex: I'm more like exploring the possibility of using rust for something I'm also exploring the possibility of doing

2018-09-25 17:22:43	+Kirjava	I try and do it every year
2018-09-25 17:22:50	+Kirjava	last year I used it to learn rust ^_^

2018-09-25 17:23:24	+brooks	so I might not even be right, rip
2018-09-25 17:23:32	+Kirjava	that makes sense, (probably physical design reasons, again)
2018-09-25 17:23:41	+brooks	I tried to do advent of code a few years ago to learn perl6 but ended up not doing it
2018-09-25 17:23:44	+Kirjava	but that doesn't explain why reading from unaligned causes an interrupt
2018-09-25 17:23:53	+brooks	that, I have no idea about
2018-09-25 17:24:20	+Kirjava	it's possible I wouldn't understand it even if it was explained due to lack of engineering knowledge

2018-09-25 18:13:59	+brooks	it probably is, yeah, but the politics are really blatant
2018-09-25 18:14:06	+brooks	because the 70s were a really critical time politically
2018-09-25 18:14:08	+brooks	and it shows
2018-09-25 18:14:14	+naught0	red is my father
2018-09-25 18:14:16	+naught0	and I am hyde
2018-09-25 18:14:27	+naught0	if hyde was related by blood
2018-09-25 18:14:43	+naught0	it just seems too typical to really be a pointed statement / analysis of the times
2018-09-25 18:14:54	+naught0	Like, "Oh, here's a typical 70s white family"
2018-09-25 18:15:02	+brooks	the setup is always pretty typical, that's not the part I'm talking about
2018-09-25 18:15:14	+naught0	brooks be like "THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL CRITIQUE OF SOCIETY"
2018-09-25 18:15:40	+brooks	remember that time they literally plotted to ask a naive dumbass who supports the government to ask a scripted question to gerald ford
2018-09-25 18:15:44	+brooks	and they picked red
2018-09-25 18:15:52	+brooks	because he believed in the american dream
2018-09-25 18:15:57	 *	darkwater has a job in rust now
2018-09-25 18:16:00	+brooks	and fucking bob was part of this group?
2018-09-25 18:16:10	+naught0	I do remember
2018-09-25 18:16:14	+naught0	it's a sitcom
2018-09-25 18:16:17	+naught0	it created comedy
2018-09-25 18:16:26	+brooks	and then red choked on asking a disrespecting question and only got his courage back after eric streaked wearing a nixon mask!
2018-09-25 18:16:42	+brooks	I mean bojack horseman is also a sitcom and a comedy idk what your point is
2018-09-25 18:16:54	+naught0	I think you're reading into it 
2018-09-25 18:16:57	+LambdaComplex	darkwater: jelly
2018-09-25 18:16:58	+brooks	I said it was the best sitcom, not the best show ever made
2018-09-25 18:17:01	+brooks	darkwater: nice!
2018-09-25 18:17:22	+naught0	I feel the show is more superficial than you think it is
2018-09-25 18:17:31	+naught0	But that's probably because I enjoy it as a superficial dumb show
2018-09-25 18:17:31	+darkwater	first thing i did is write a tcp server with tokio that parses some things
2018-09-25 18:17:34	+brooks	oh it absolutely is, especially as the show goes on
2018-09-25 18:17:34	+darkwater	msgpack
2018-09-25 18:17:38	+darkwater	shit's gonna b fun
2018-09-25 18:17:49	+brooks	by the end the show is totally off the rails
2018-09-25 18:18:04	+naught0	well it's shit after a while tbh
2018-09-25 18:18:08	+naught0	I only watch the first few seasons
2018-09-25 18:18:10	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-25 18:18:22	+brooks	also I don't actually love the show or anything, aside from mostly nostalgia
2018-09-25 18:18:29	+naught0	did you know the actress that played lori legit just up and died
2018-09-25 18:18:34	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-25 18:18:41	+brooks	she had lost a baby right
2018-09-25 18:18:44	+naught0	fun fact: she was in an Xfiles episode
2018-09-25 18:19:01	+brooks	oh huh
2018-09-25 18:19:05	+brooks	which season
2018-09-25 18:19:45	+naught0	lemme find it!
2018-09-25 18:19:50	+naught0	she and a friend are highschool witches and kill boys
2018-09-25 18:19:53	+naught0	it's great
2018-09-25 18:20:08	+brooks	that IS great
2018-09-25 18:20:09	+naught0	S3E13
2018-09-25 18:20:17	+naught0	I still haven't finished the x files
2018-09-25 18:20:21	+brooks	I haven't either
2018-09-25 18:20:28	+brooks	I stopped somewhere in s5? it was boring and weird at that point
2018-09-25 18:20:32	+brooks	I heard it picks back up though
2018-09-25 18:20:34	+naught0	I think I made it past
2018-09-25 18:20:37	+naught0	yeah
2018-09-25 18:20:46	+naught0	you know why it initially ended right
2018-09-25 18:20:51	+brooks	I don't
2018-09-25 18:20:57	+naught0	ok won't spoil
2018-09-25 18:21:02	+brooks	ah kk
2018-09-25 18:21:06	+brooks	I was gonna say I have to leave in a few minutes
2018-09-25 18:21:14	+naught0	> leaving
2018-09-25 18:21:17	+naught0	> lifing

2018-09-25 18:30:41	+dysfigured	i mean try it, build something non-trivial with it and see how you like it
2018-09-25 18:31:01	+naught0	the example of the snake game is really cool
2018-09-25 18:31:45	+naught0	looks kinda dumb with html mixed in but still
2018-09-25 18:32:27	+naught0	also I can't make anything "non-trivial" 
2018-09-25 18:32:32	+naught0	my magnum opus is a python discord bot :~)
2018-09-25 18:32:52	+dysfigured	i mean that sounds non-trivial
2018-09-25 18:33:14	+dysfigured	irc bots can be p difficult depending on how much you leave up to libs
2018-09-25 18:34:29	+Arathnim	Or how general and expressive you make the command definition framework.

2018-09-25 18:37:49	+Arathnim	It's a good project for exploring new languages with, since it covers a lot of domains: parsing, networking, threads, representing commands.
2018-09-25 18:37:54	+dysfigured	i'm not trying to even look at new languages until i'm better at python and haskell, in that order, maybe with coconut in-between, and maybe clojure at a later date iiff i get all that done
2018-09-25 18:38:21	+dysfigured	maybe rust will be good by then
2018-09-25 18:38:40	+Kirjava	what makes u think it isn't now
2018-09-25 18:38:41	+Arathnim	Thems fightin' words.

2018-09-25 18:42:26	+dysfigured	well, not rn rn, but i made a few last night

2018-09-25 18:45:18	+naught0	thats a fantastic autocorrect
2018-09-25 18:45:35	+dysfigured	rust just seems super immature to me still, in both language design/goals and in it's ecosystem. and it just has absolute nothing that makes me go "oh shit i need this"
2018-09-25 18:46:05	+naught0	it makes u feel safe n warm
2018-09-25 18:46:31	+brooks	can you elaborate on that?
2018-09-25 18:46:42	+Arathnim	brooks: That's probably the best description of Rust I've heard.
2018-09-25 18:46:54	+Kirjava	immature how though
2018-09-25 18:47:12	+Kirjava	you can't mean the tooling, as that's far ahead of many others atm
2018-09-25 18:47:49	+dysfigured	immature in that there's still not tons of libraries to do all kinds of shit
2018-09-25 18:48:10	+dysfigured	all the rust libs are ports of other things that already exist, playing catch-up with everything else
2018-09-25 18:48:18	+brooks	I don't think so
2018-09-25 18:48:23	+Kirjava	I don't really have trouble finding libraries to do what I want
2018-09-25 18:48:27	+Kirjava	do you have a specific example
2018-09-25 18:48:40	+Kirjava	also bear in mind you can just use C libs if you really need to
2018-09-25 18:48:54	+brooks	I'm not even learning it and I've still seen a lot of libraries that aren't clones and are interesting in their own right 
2018-09-25 18:49:08	+brooks	the argument parsing library for example
2018-09-25 18:49:09	+Kirjava	a valid point of criticism is the UI story
2018-09-25 18:49:15	+Kirjava	which is definitely immature
2018-09-25 18:49:19	+Kirjava	but you haven't mentioned that
2018-09-25 18:49:56	+Kirjava	it's only second to javascript for frontend code too, which may be a point of "oh shit I need this"
2018-09-25 18:49:57	+brooks	that's the most frustrating point for me because I wanted to finally make the jump to a ~compiled~ language and start making GUIs
2018-09-25 18:50:00	+brooks	in the same move
2018-09-25 18:50:10	+brooks	**4 years ago**
2018-09-25 18:50:11	+Kirjava	brooks: GTK is pretty good
2018-09-25 18:50:18	+Arathnim	Common Lisp?
2018-09-25 18:50:22	+dysfigured	make guis in python, pyqt and pygtk are pretty much the best bindings that exist
2018-09-25 18:50:31	+Arathnim	(n
2018-09-25 18:50:36	+brooks	I cannot stand python 
2018-09-25 18:50:39	+dysfigured	same
2018-09-25 18:50:41	+naught0	stop it you guys
2018-09-25 18:50:43	+brooks	it makes me feel suffocated 
2018-09-25 18:50:44	+naught0	python is cute
2018-09-25 18:50:45	+Kirjava	I think GUI stuff is the only complaint you could have really
2018-09-25 18:50:48	+naught0	it's pretty :)
2018-09-25 18:50:48	+Kirjava	and it's not *that* bad
2018-09-25 18:50:58	+Arathnim	(n.b. not a serious suggestion)
2018-09-25 18:51:08	+brooks	heh
2018-09-25 18:51:11	+Kirjava	you can always just use XCB if you need to :^)
2018-09-25 18:51:14	+Arathnim	And I feel the same way about python.
2018-09-25 18:51:22	+brooks	Arathnim++
2018-09-25 18:51:23	+naught0	what kind of python are you reading / writing

2018-09-25 18:51:30	+naught0	because shit's comfy af

2018-09-25 18:51:32	+dysfigured	i don't have *objective* criticisms or rust, it just has absolutely nothing that appeals to me

2018-09-25 18:52:32	+dysfigured	>rust is functional~ >mut everywhere
2018-09-25 18:52:40	+brooks	it is not functional

2018-09-25 18:52:53	+naught0	mfw friend has a discord nim library
2018-09-25 18:52:54	+Kirjava	rust is mixed functional/imperative
2018-09-25 18:52:56	+naught0	mfw it segfaults on ratelimits
2018-09-25 18:53:08	+Kirjava	you can write most things either way
2018-09-25 18:53:27	+Kirjava	but some things are just not possible to write functionally in such a low level language, or it does not make sense to do so
2018-09-25 18:53:30	+Arathnim	naught0: I like it as much as other languages like JS, but the semantic freedom offered by lisp is hard to match.
2018-09-25 18:54:09	+Kirjava	and yeah lazy evaluated iterators are real nice :)
2018-09-25 18:54:12	+dysfigured	i'd like to see the functional side of rust fleshed out more by the community, especially with it's supposed zero cost abstractions
2018-09-25 18:54:19	+naught0	Arathnim: every lisp i've seen looks horrifying
2018-09-25 18:54:22	+Kirjava	> supposed
2018-09-25 18:54:28	+dysfigured	Kirjava: those came from clojure
2018-09-25 18:54:30	+Kirjava	are they secretly not zero cost
2018-09-25 18:54:39	+dysfigured	idk maybe?
2018-09-25 18:54:40	+naught0	(((((((())))))))
2018-09-25 18:54:43	+dysfigured	idk shit about it
2018-09-25 18:55:01	+Kirjava	oh ok it just made it sound like you thought they weren't reall zero cost is all
2018-09-25 18:55:39	+Arathnim	You get used to the parens. Although you could just rewrite the syntax to be like python, which I've actually done before.
2018-09-25 18:55:55	+dysfigured	i read what's on the label, i turn it around in my hands and look at it, in the background everyone is frothing at the mouth for it, i'm scratching my head wondering what's so great
2018-09-25 18:56:13	+dysfigured	also i'm high and i need to live for work and it's raining
2018-09-25 18:56:26	+dysfigured	s/live/leave/ thanks hands
2018-09-25 18:56:49	+naught0	doing drugs is illegal and therefore immoral open up ur under arrest
2018-09-25 18:56:49	+Kirjava	fair enough. maybe give it a shot on something that is appropriately suited to it to get a better idea of why people like it?
2018-09-25 18:56:55	+Kirjava	the functional stuff isn't just iterators
2018-09-25 18:56:56	+brooks	that's the same thing people say about haskell!

2018-09-25 18:57:30	+brooks	also most? everything is an expression
2018-09-25 18:57:59	+brooks	and its traits are very inspired by FP
2018-09-25 18:58:06	+brooks	but they can feel like OO
2018-09-25 18:58:09	+brooks	it's pretty neat 
2018-09-25 18:58:18	+Kirjava	traits are such a nice way of organising behaviour

2018-09-25 21:25:50	+LambdaComplex	13:56 <+brooks> I actually agree that the rust evangelism strike force has made me less enthusiastic about the language
2018-09-25 21:25:56	+LambdaComplex	brooks: did you forget that "rust" highlights me
2018-09-25 21:26:06	+LambdaComplex	i think "rustposting" does too

2018-09-25 21:26:21	+LambdaComplex	yeah it does
2018-09-25 21:27:07	+brooks	no I just forgot what I had said
2018-09-25 21:27:31	+LambdaComplex	you could...scroll up?
2018-09-25 21:27:32	+brooks	I'm actually not including you in that
2018-09-25 21:27:37	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-25 21:27:38	+brooks	I'm on a phone 
2018-09-25 21:27:39	+LambdaComplex	why not?
2018-09-25 21:27:45	+LambdaComplex	now i feel like i'm not trying hard enough!
2018-09-25 21:27:47	+LambdaComplex	;-;
2018-09-25 21:28:22	+brooks	I'm immune to your rustposting
2018-09-25 21:36:00	+brooks	it's more like
2018-09-25 21:36:52	+brooks	there's a weird combination of shitposting and moral high ground that I see when people talk about rust more than I see anyone talking about what they actually like about it, what makes it useful or powerful or fun
2018-09-25 21:37:03	+brooks	and it very much does have the "eat your vegetables" vibe I mentioned
2018-09-25 21:37:49	+brooks	and when I spent time arguing in favor of rust way back when, I did the same thing, especially since I didn't really know the language and only really understood what it was setting out to do and why
2018-09-25 21:45:49	+LambdaComplex	so brooks how much rust have you written today?

2018-09-25 21:46:22	+LambdaComplex	Well it's what you'll see in your nightmares if you don't learn Rust.

2018-09-25 21:47:01	+brooks	I don't care I want to fight rob pike
2018-09-25 21:47:07	+LambdaComplex	That's why there's a cute animal on his shirt--he is trying to lull you into a false sense of security
2018-09-25 21:47:21	+LambdaComplex	Yeah yeah blah blah joined google gave up on everything he believes in says go is "good enough" or some shit etc
2018-09-25 21:47:25	+LambdaComplex	brooks: Did that cover it?
2018-09-25 21:47:29	+brooks	I'm gonna see if I can replace c files with rust, in an existing project
2018-09-25 21:47:34	+brooks	no
2018-09-25 21:47:44	+LambdaComplex	Did it provide a high-level shitposty overview?
2018-09-25 21:48:06	+brooks	uhhhh
2018-09-25 21:48:12	+LambdaComplex	Also 16:43 <+brooks> I'm gonna see if I can replace c files with rust, in an existing project
2018-09-25 21:48:14	+LambdaComplex	When you say that
2018-09-25 21:48:15	+brooks	not really, I think the part about go is too far off base
2018-09-25 21:48:31	+LambdaComplex	Do you mean you're going to find information on if it's possible? 
2018-09-25 21:48:32	+brooks	the first part is right
2018-09-25 21:48:34	+LambdaComplex	Or that you're going to attempt it?
2018-09-25 21:48:37	+brooks	both
2018-09-25 21:48:39	+brooks	former first
2018-09-25 21:48:59	+brooks	I think it is possible, but I may not know enough about how C projects build to get it to work
2018-09-25 21:49:28	+LambdaComplex	My gut is telling me that attempting FFI with Rust when you're not familiar with Rust might be a Bad Idea
2018-09-25 21:49:37	+LambdaComplex	I've never even tried calling Rust from C though so I could be wrong
2018-09-25 21:49:39	+trinary	brooks - Relevant: https://github.com/immunant/c2rust
2018-09-25 21:50:51	+brooks	thanks
2018-09-25 21:57:50	+Kirjava	for rust from C you just need #[no_mangle] and extern "C"
2018-09-25 21:58:16	+Kirjava	also c2rust generates some... interersting code

2018-09-25 22:03:22	+Kirjava	guess not
2018-09-25 22:04:32	+Kirjava	ah
2018-09-25 22:04:37	+Kirjava	I think you need a compiler flag
2018-09-25 22:04:56	+trinary	If there was something to enable all features, I'd do that
2018-09-25 22:05:12	+trinary	But I'm not going to enable every little thing individually
2018-09-25 22:05:30	+Kirjava	does it use cargo or just rustc
2018-09-25 22:06:04	+Kirjava	wait I can check :32
2018-09-25 22:07:00	+Kirjava	damn those are some heavy flags already

2018-09-25 22:19:06	+Kirjava	NOT PRETTY
2018-09-25 22:19:22	+trinary	It doesn't need to be pretty
2018-09-25 22:19:48	+Kirjava	maybe it does if you intend to actually work on the code instead of just port it
2018-09-25 22:20:02	+trinary	Not really
2018-09-25 22:20:17	+Kirjava	ok true
2018-09-25 22:20:22	+Kirjava	*it would be nice
2018-09-25 22:27:08	+trinary	Porting C line-by-line will not result in good (let alone idiomatic) code
2018-09-25 22:27:37	+trinary	Porting function-by-function isn't good either, but still better. And ugly Rust suffices for that
2018-09-25 22:27:46	+Kirjava	sure
2018-09-25 22:27:51	+Kirjava	you can just clean it up by hand
2018-09-25 22:27:59	+Kirjava	I guess

2018-09-25 23:23:10	+Nux	warranty*
2018-09-25 23:23:17	+Uncled1023	I'm thinking of looking for a cheap 1080 TI once the 2080 TI comes out
2018-09-25 23:23:18	+brooks	yo check this out https://www.ebay.com/itm/132795186511
2018-09-25 23:23:18	+Nux	i thought it had like 90 days since refurb'd
2018-09-25 23:23:39	+brooks	same problem with BIOS though
2018-09-25 23:23:53	+brooks	it also has the NVIDIA gpu
2018-09-25 23:24:02	+Nux	ya id rather go through best buy and lenovo
2018-09-25 23:24:07	+Nux	and have a warranty
2018-09-25 23:24:13	+brooks	yeah that's fair
2018-09-25 23:24:31	+Nux	even though the last time i used a warranty on lenovo it was a head ache
2018-09-25 23:24:43	+Nux	the first day i got my g500s i had to send it back
2018-09-25 23:24:50	+brooks	I'm not sure I've ever used a warranty for anything
2018-09-25 23:24:54	+Nux	cause the screen was leaking led back light really bad
2018-09-25 23:25:05	+brooks	I used to get them when I bought anything
2018-09-25 23:25:07	+Nux	when i got it back, they had reflashed winblows on it
2018-09-25 23:25:08	+brooks	damn
2018-09-25 23:25:12	+brooks	....lmao
2018-09-25 23:25:21	+Nux	which was ok, cause i was taking it off anyway
2018-09-25 23:25:29	+Nux	but like 3 months later the battery went out
2018-09-25 23:25:45	+Nux	and they tried to make me put windows back on it. to "properly trouble shoot"
2018-09-25 23:25:56	+brooks	that sounds about right
2018-09-25 23:25:57	+Nux	after 20 min back and forth with the supervisor they ok'd it
2018-09-25 23:26:07	+Nux	but wanted me to send it to them instead of sending me a battery
2018-09-25 23:26:16	+Nux	i said ya no, cause ill get it back with windows on it
2018-09-25 23:26:34	+Nux	i said if i can keep my HDD ya ill send it to you
2018-09-25 23:26:36	+Nux	and they said no
2018-09-25 23:26:50	+Nux	so i had a broken battery for two years till it died
2018-09-25 23:27:03	+Nux	had to be plugged in
2018-09-25 23:27:06	+Nux	wouldnt hold a charge
2018-09-25 23:27:17	+brooks	that fucking sucks
2018-09-25 23:27:20	+Nux	yup
2018-09-25 23:27:51	+Nux	lenovos are usually really good wih linux
2018-09-25 23:28:01	+Nux	so this bios shit is really got me thinking wtf why
2018-09-25 23:29:13	+Uncled1023	Besides the crappy malware they put on them, lenovo isn't half bad
2018-09-25 23:29:24	+Uncled1023	I had their little tablet way back when, and it was nice!
2018-09-25 23:30:02	+Nux	ya i dont have a problem with them, and that malware was all windows pup shit
2018-09-25 23:30:07	+Nux	so doesnt effect me
2018-09-25 23:30:20	+Nux	tfw youre an Uncled1023 and have to worry about that
2018-09-25 23:34:11	+brooks	didn't lenovo get bought out in like 2012 or something
2018-09-25 23:34:58	+brooks	looks like no
2018-09-25 23:35:25	+Uncled1023	:^)
2018-09-25 23:35:34	+Nux	naw
2018-09-25 23:35:39	+Nux	they bought IBMs shit
2018-09-25 23:35:41	+Nux	for think pad
2018-09-25 23:35:44	+Nux	in like 04
2018-09-25 23:36:16	+Nux	they own motorola mobility and zuk mobile and medion
2018-09-25 23:37:25	+Nux	damn they actually own a lot of shit
2018-09-25 23:42:30	+brooks	I have two questions
2018-09-25 23:42:48	+brooks	never mind I have one question
2018-09-25 23:43:02	+brooks	how do I re-initilize ttys with sysvinit 
2018-09-25 23:43:11	+brooks	I changed inittab
2018-09-25 23:48:01	+Nux	ps ax | grep tty
2018-09-25 23:48:05	+Nux	kill the process
2018-09-25 23:48:24	+brooks	I did, but it doesn't reinitialize
2018-09-25 23:48:30	+brooks	I mean it comes back up, but not with the new arguments
2018-09-25 23:48:39	+brooks	I need to tell the init it's been updated and to change how it runs it
2018-09-25 23:48:52	+Nux	you can also ctrl + alt +f? to go to that ty
2018-09-25 23:48:55	+Nux	tty
2018-09-25 23:49:10	+Nux	f2 f3 tty2 tty3 etc
2018-09-25 23:49:58	+brooks	I can get to the tty, and kill it, it's just that I can't change its arguments
2018-09-25 23:50:04	+brooks	I think I found the answer though?
2018-09-25 23:50:07	+brooks	sec testin'
2018-09-25 23:50:18	+Nux	run reset
2018-09-25 23:50:37	+Nux	just .bak .inputrc if you have that
2018-09-25 23:51:51	+Nux	do rasp pi's have the ability to into audio
2018-09-25 23:52:48	+Kirjava	hi nux
2018-09-25 23:53:08	+brooks	they should
2018-09-25 23:53:11	+brooks	they can do hdmi
2018-09-25 23:53:19	+brooks	and support audio that way
2018-09-25 23:53:21	+Kirjava	is hdmi like html
2018-09-25 23:53:26	+brooks	n-no
2018-09-25 23:53:35	+brooks	wait do you really not know what hdmi is
2018-09-25 23:53:51	+brooks	it's an a/v interface
2018-09-25 23:54:00	+Kirjava	yes I know what hdmi is :)
2018-09-25 23:54:02	+brooks	oh ok
2018-09-25 23:54:08	+brooks	I was happy to explain!
2018-09-25 23:54:22	+Kirjava	I saw das kew
2018-09-25 23:54:24	+brooks	Nux: turns out it's telinit q
2018-09-25 23:54:33	+Kirjava	I wish I could stay and chat but I have to go do life stuff
2018-09-25 23:54:37	+Kirjava	BYE
2018-09-25 23:55:20	+brooks	rip
2018-09-25 23:55:22	+brooks	good luck
2018-09-25 23:55:46	+brooks	after running telinit q, I could kill the tty processes and when they reset they were how I wanted
2018-09-25 23:56:41	+Nux	brooks: yes i even ran amixer cset numid=3 2
2018-09-25 23:56:43	+Nux	no go
2018-09-25 23:56:53	+brooks	weird
2018-09-25 23:57:04	+brooks	lspci and look for audio ig
2018-09-25 23:57:09	+Nux	ight
2018-09-25 23:58:29	+Nux	i think its the stupid OS thats on it
2018-09-25 23:58:37	+Nux	suse server enterprise
2018-09-25 23:58:43	+brooks	that sounds likely
2018-09-25 23:58:49	+brooks	you prob don't have audio built in
2018-09-25 23:59:17	+Nux	i dont know he sent it to me with this OS on it
2018-09-25 23:59:18	+Nux	but w/e
2018-09-25 23:59:22	+Nux	why*

2018-09-26 00:02:18	+LambdaComplex	but i already know what it is now
2018-09-26 00:02:20	+LambdaComplex	hmm
2018-09-26 00:02:30	+Nux	LOL
2018-09-26 00:02:33	+LambdaComplex	Nux: you missed nothing but me saying "hi #code" again btw
2018-09-26 00:02:45	+Nux	i ssh'd into irc screen from rpi
2018-09-26 00:02:55	+Nux	it using stock xterm
2018-09-26 00:02:56	+LambdaComplex	1337 H4XX
2018-09-26 00:02:58	+Nux	this is so ugly
2018-09-26 00:02:58	+LambdaComplex	3ew
2018-09-26 00:03:00	+LambdaComplex	*ew
2018-09-26 00:03:04	+LambdaComplex	nice white background
2018-09-26 00:03:09	+LambdaComplex	burns your eyes reallll good
2018-09-26 00:03:12	+Nux	oh ya
2018-09-26 00:03:19	+Nux	plus its on a 32 inch tv
2018-09-26 00:03:29	+LambdaComplex	must look like daylight in that room
2018-09-26 00:03:31	+Nux	actually 42
2018-09-26 00:03:31	+brooks	well I can explain why C is objectively the best language there is instead
2018-09-26 00:03:32	+Nux	i think
2018-09-26 00:03:41	+LambdaComplex	"It isn't"
2018-09-26 00:03:44	+LambdaComplex	brooks: like that?
2018-09-26 00:03:47	+brooks	yes
2018-09-26 00:03:55	+LambdaComplex	brooks: that was exactly what you were going to say, wasn' it
2018-09-26 00:03:59	+LambdaComplex	*wasn't
2018-09-26 00:04:08	+brooks	no I was going to do something much more shitposty
2018-09-26 00:04:16	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-26 00:04:18	+LambdaComplex	hmmmm
2018-09-26 00:04:30	+Nux	about to push this shit to the limits
2018-09-26 00:04:37	+LambdaComplex	"Because it pretends the CPU follows some abstract model that it actually hasn't physically reflected in several decades"
2018-09-26 00:04:39	+LambdaComplex	:^)
2018-09-26 00:04:42	+LambdaComplex	brooks: how was that
2018-09-26 00:04:44	+Nux	i zypper install gtk2* gtk3*
2018-09-26 00:04:50	+brooks	closer
2018-09-26 00:05:20	+Nux	btw zypper is the gayes package manager
2018-09-26 00:05:22	+brooks	I was going to start talking about how C and unix are intrinsically linked and how you can't have one without the other
2018-09-26 00:05:24	+Nux	gayest
2018-09-26 00:05:31	+brooks	I'm not familiar with it
2018-09-26 00:05:37	+brooks	is it the opensuse one?
2018-09-26 00:05:44	+Nux	yes
2018-09-26 00:05:47	+Nux	this entire os
2018-09-26 00:05:48	+Nux	sucks
2018-09-26 00:05:52	+Nux	i had to register it
2018-09-26 00:05:55	+Nux	in order to update
2018-09-26 00:06:08	+brooks	it was one of the first experiences I had with linux
2018-09-26 00:06:11	+brooks	I fucking hated it
2018-09-26 00:06:14	+brooks	wasn't enterprise though
2018-09-26 00:06:40	+Nux	what sucks is i have another sd card thats 128gb but no way to write an os to it
2018-09-26 00:06:44	+Nux	i tried using my phone
2018-09-26 00:06:48	+LambdaComplex	what's the point at which a mysql database is so large that it may affect performance?
2018-09-26 00:06:49	+Nux	but that didnt work
2018-09-26 00:06:58	+LambdaComplex	10s of thousands of rows? 100s of thousands? millions?
2018-09-26 00:07:07	+brooks	no idea
2018-09-26 00:07:12	+Nux	ive seen 400 DBs on one server before
2018-09-26 00:07:25	+Nux	like 400 full site DB's
2018-09-26 00:07:42	+Nux	some hosting companies customer was sqli vuln
2018-09-26 00:07:50	+brooks	Nux: maybe you can run the OS in ram and write to the sd card you booted from
2018-09-26 00:07:51	+Nux	which gave axx to ALL their customers DB's
2018-09-26 00:08:08	+Nux	brooks i dont get what you mean,
2018-09-26 00:08:14	+Nux	my computer cant take an sd card
2018-09-26 00:08:17	+LambdaComplex	so, context: we're working on a program that runs traceroutes and saves their output in a database
2018-09-26 00:08:29	+LambdaComplex	so that routes and their latencies can be analyzed over time
2018-09-26 00:08:35	+LambdaComplex	"he pointed out a mysql db would probably bog down and slow to a crawl after it had a few thousand entries in it"
2018-09-26 00:08:40	+brooks	I mean you might be able to boot into RAM on the pi, then safely a new img to the sd card the old OS was on
2018-09-26 00:08:41	+LambdaComplex	i am questioning the validity of this statement
2018-09-26 00:08:51	+LambdaComplex	assume one traceroute has ~10-15 hops max
2018-09-26 00:08:53	+brooks	I am doubtful at best
2018-09-26 00:09:08	+Nux	LambdaComplex: lol wut
2018-09-26 00:09:10	+brooks	mysql is designed for higher performance shit along these lines, isn't it
2018-09-26 00:09:11	+Nux	youll be fine
2018-09-26 00:09:52	+Nux	lambda i have an vps with phpmyadmin on it, that isnt being used
2018-09-26 00:09:55	+Nux	if you wanna test it
2018-09-26 00:10:08	+LambdaComplex	this is for work. we can spin up VMs whenever we want
2018-09-26 00:10:10	+LambdaComplex	ty tho <3
2018-09-26 00:10:13	+Nux	tru
2018-09-26 00:10:15	+LambdaComplex	but still
2018-09-26 00:10:27	+LambdaComplex	even if by "entry" he meant "a traceroute" (rather than "a hop")
2018-09-26 00:10:30	+Nux	but ya who ever is telling you that
2018-09-26 00:10:32	+Nux	is dumb af
2018-09-26 00:10:33	+LambdaComplex	a few thousand would be like...15,000
2018-09-26 00:10:35	+LambdaComplex	records
2018-09-26 00:10:38	+LambdaComplex	that's small af
2018-09-26 00:11:03	+LambdaComplex	Nux: it's the CEO who said that though ;-;
2018-09-26 00:11:13	+LambdaComplex	who, regarding a lot of tech shit, definitely knows way more than i do
2018-09-26 00:11:22	+LambdaComplex	but either i'm misinterpreting what he's saying or that's pretty wrong
2018-09-26 00:11:56	+Nux	fuck it lets go make a huge as db
2018-09-26 00:11:58	+Nux	with bs in it
2018-09-26 00:12:02	+LambdaComplex	do itttt
2018-09-26 00:12:22	+Nux	lemme look for some sample ones i cant just re do over and over
2018-09-26 00:12:55	+Nux	i have a lot of leaked .sql db's that have millions of entries in them
2018-09-26 00:13:07	+Nux	but not sure i wanna publicly host those
2018-09-26 00:13:30	+LambdaComplex	but if it's leaked then it's already public :^)
2018-09-26 00:13:37	+Nux	well
2018-09-26 00:13:48	+Nux	it shared in UG circles
2018-09-26 00:14:03	+Nux	its not illegal tho
2018-09-26 00:14:06	+Nux	till you sell them
2018-09-26 00:14:24	+Nux	thats "trafficking in PII"
2018-09-26 00:15:27	+Nux	btw if you want me to run a (local) grep for unames/emails i can
2018-09-26 00:15:53	+Nux	so you can change yo shit if it needs it
2018-09-26 00:17:15	+LambdaComplex	although apparently the CEO said something about setting this up to do once traceroute a minute? in which case....this could get very big very fast
2018-09-26 00:17:25	+LambdaComplex	hmmmm
2018-09-26 00:18:05	+Nux	 why not just do json
2018-09-26 00:18:07	+Nux	then
2018-09-26 00:18:58	+LambdaComplex	because there's like several decades worth of tooling around grabbing data from SQL databases and working with it/analyzing it/etc
2018-09-26 00:19:00	+LambdaComplex	and json is json
2018-09-26 00:19:16	+LambdaComplex	also we might put the data in grafana(?)
2018-09-26 00:19:21	+LambdaComplex	maybe influxdb would be a good choice
2018-09-26 00:19:30	+LambdaComplex	if you haven't noticed this is still in the fairly early stages :P
2018-09-26 00:19:38	+brooks	LambdaComplex: teach me how to know stuff
2018-09-26 00:19:43	+Nux	same
2018-09-26 00:20:04	+Nux	ill teach you how to haxor
2018-09-26 00:20:12	+LambdaComplex	brooks: like what
2018-09-26 00:20:25	+Nux	one day i will convert LambdaComplex to hacker god
2018-09-26 00:20:27	+Nux	just wait
2018-09-26 00:20:32	+LambdaComplex	like that song by eminem?
2018-09-26 00:20:35	+LambdaComplex	no wait that's different
2018-09-26 00:20:38	+Nux	lol
2018-09-26 00:21:04	+brooks	im beginning to feel like a hax god
2018-09-26 00:21:09	+brooks	all my people from the front to he back nod
2018-09-26 00:21:26	+LambdaComplex	brooks: EXPLAIN YOUR COMMENT
2018-09-26 00:21:27	+brooks	LambdaComplex: like sysadminy shit that I wouldn't encounter just adminning my own systems
2018-09-26 00:21:30	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-26 00:21:41	+Nux	i wanna redo that song now
2018-09-26 00:21:41	+LambdaComplex	brooks: go read about ipmi
2018-09-26 00:21:49	+Nux	and bgp
2018-09-26 00:21:53	+LambdaComplex	and then ask yourself "why the fuck does everyone's ipmi implementation SUCK"
2018-09-26 00:21:57	+LambdaComplex	fucking supermicro
2018-09-26 00:22:00	+LambdaComplex	"Do you want quit?"

2018-09-26 00:34:55	+gnu	tpb
2018-09-26 00:34:56	+LambdaComplex	brooks: i was asking recommendations for a PCIe network interface card
2018-09-26 00:35:36	+LambdaComplex	brooks: And he was like....naming a bunch of chipsets just off the top of his head or some shit
2018-09-26 00:36:35	+brooks	this sounds about right
2018-09-26 00:36:38	+LambdaComplex	And shit like "Well this one would be best because it has vm queues but if you aren't running VMs then it doesn't matter"
2018-09-26 00:37:01	+brooks	I'm sort of...slowly, too slowly, stumbling upon the kinds of habits and hobbies that will be 'compound interest', but for certain things I don't think I'm there
2018-09-26 00:37:23	+brooks	what did you need a PCIe nic for
2018-09-26 00:37:29	+LambdaComplex	Need?
2018-09-26 00:37:31	+LambdaComplex	Not a damn thing
2018-09-26 00:37:41	+LambdaComplex	But now I can fuck around with link aggregation
2018-09-26 00:37:44	+LambdaComplex	Or bonded NICs
2018-09-26 00:37:45	+brooks	I mean you must have had some reason you wanted it to be PCIe
2018-09-26 00:37:47	+LambdaComplex	Or whatever you wanna call them
2018-09-26 00:37:58	+brooks	wait that's a thing huh
2018-09-26 00:37:58	+LambdaComplex	Yeah, I have PCIe slots in my computer :P
2018-09-26 00:38:03	+LambdaComplex	What's a thing
2018-09-26 00:38:06	+LambdaComplex	Link aggregation?
2018-09-26 00:38:16	+brooks	bonding nics
2018-09-26 00:38:19	+LambdaComplex	samething
2018-09-26 00:38:21	+LambdaComplex	But yeah
2018-09-26 00:38:26	+LambdaComplex	So now I can do e.g. LACP
2018-09-26 00:38:37	+LambdaComplex	Or one of the other modes that Linux supports
2018-09-26 00:38:58	+brooks	ok I had to look these terms up but now I'm starting to see
2018-09-26 00:39:26	+brooks	can you actually hit bottlenecks in your nic or cabling that are lower than what's provided by a commercial ISP?
2018-09-26 00:39:28	+LambdaComplex	Linux calls it a bonded interface, FreeBSD calls it a lagg(4) interface
2018-09-26 00:39:44	+LambdaComplex	OpenBSD calls it trunk(4) for some reason
2018-09-26 00:40:12	+LambdaComplex	(Cisco at least uses the word "trunk" to refer to a port that carries multiple VLANs. OpenBSD's usage annoyed my networking teacher. A lot.)
2018-09-26 00:40:24	+LambdaComplex	((OpenBSD and FreeBSD both use vlan(4) for vlans)
2018-09-26 00:40:26	+LambdaComplex	)
2018-09-26 00:40:34	+LambdaComplex	brooks: Lol no
2018-09-26 00:40:53	+LambdaComplex	These are 1Gbps interfaces
2018-09-26 00:41:21	+LambdaComplex	But I'm good for redundancy :D
2018-09-26 00:41:32	+brooks	kek
2018-09-26 00:41:39	+LambdaComplex	Also, reminder that all my PC's network traffic is flowing through an OpenBSD box
2018-09-26 00:41:43	+LambdaComplex	Why? Because I can, that's why
2018-09-26 00:41:53	+brooks	what's the box
2018-09-26 00:42:05	+brooks	WHAT'S IN THE BO~X
2018-09-26 00:42:19	+LambdaComplex	pcengines apu4b4
2018-09-26 00:42:39	+LambdaComplex	ooh, fun thing about link aggregation that I may do
2018-09-26 00:42:53	+LambdaComplex	which is also suggested in at least one of the BSD's guides for configuring networking on a laptop
2018-09-26 00:43:13	+LambdaComplex	Bond your physical interface and your wireless interface together and set the wireless one as a fallback
2018-09-26 00:43:19	+LambdaComplex	I might do that with my openbsd box at some point
2018-09-26 00:43:31	+brooks	...vaguely, related question
2018-09-26 00:43:32	+LambdaComplex	So then I could just unplug the WAN cable and it would automatically connect to the main router over wifi
2018-09-26 00:43:45	+brooks	questions
2018-09-26 00:44:23	+brooks	if I replace the nic in my laptop, can something other than the card or cable be a bottleneck? if the answer is theoretically yes, is it practically yes with hardware that's ~10 years old?
2018-09-26 00:44:35	+brooks	that is actually pretty cool
2018-09-26 00:44:42	+brooks	except wifi is an abomination, but still cool
2018-09-26 00:45:07	+LambdaComplex	What's an abomination is the fact that the wifi card I put in isn't even officially supported by OpenBSD :(
2018-09-26 00:45:20	+LambdaComplex	(And it probably doesn't support hostap mode. reeee)
2018-09-26 00:45:48	+LambdaComplex	brooks: tbh idk. i'd assume the CPU could be a bottleneck
2018-09-26 00:46:02	+LambdaComplex	What speed is the NIC that's in it currently?
2018-09-26 00:46:07	+LambdaComplex	100Mbps? 1G?
2018-09-26 00:46:14	+Uncled1023	10G
2018-09-26 00:46:16	+brooks	1 gb I think 
2018-09-26 00:46:25	+bdelloid	raaaaaaa
2018-09-26 00:46:27	+brooks	now that you mention it
2018-09-26 00:46:37	+Uncled1023	>not tapping directly into the trans-atlantic cable
2018-09-26 00:46:44	+Uncled1023	Do you  even ISP
2018-09-26 00:46:45	+LambdaComplex	If you're replacing a 1G NIC with a 1G NIC then I'm gonna assume you'll be fine
2018-09-26 00:47:07	+brooks	yeah I just got carried away by the unfamiliarity 
2018-09-26 00:47:09	+brooks	rip
2018-09-26 00:47:49	+LambdaComplex	Uncled1023: yes
2018-09-26 00:47:51	+LambdaComplex	:^)
2018-09-26 00:48:07	+LambdaComplex	i hooked my laptop directly up to our DC's main network a few times
2018-09-26 00:48:16	+LambdaComplex	because there was a free cable and I knew how the interface was configured. kek
2018-09-26 00:48:19	+LambdaComplex	600 Mbps
2018-09-26 00:48:21	+LambdaComplex	mmmmm
2018-09-26 00:49:35	+LambdaComplex	and the vpn only dropped it to 3 Mbps!
2018-09-26 00:49:37	+LambdaComplex	:D
2018-09-26 00:49:39	+LambdaComplex	(killme)

2018-09-26 00:52:08	+LambdaComplex	not me
2018-09-26 00:52:39	+LambdaComplex	hey brooks i have a question
2018-09-26 00:52:52	+LambdaComplex	brooks: when would you use ospf and when would you use bgp
2018-09-26 00:53:13	+brooks	I've no idea what either of those are
2018-09-26 00:53:35	+LambdaComplex	Open Shortest Path First and Border Gateway Protocol
2018-09-26 00:53:42	+brooks	reminder that when I was talking about network programming I was in the process of figuring out that I knew nothing about networking
2018-09-26 00:53:59	+LambdaComplex	as if i would forget that
2018-09-26 00:54:00	+LambdaComplex	;)
2018-09-26 00:54:03	+brooks	nice
2018-09-26 00:54:05	+brooks	good
2018-09-26 00:54:16	+LambdaComplex	there's also EIGRP but that's not used that much since it used to be proprietary
2018-09-26 00:54:39	+brooks	once proprietary always proprietary >:(
2018-09-26 00:54:47	+LambdaComplex	pls
2018-09-26 00:54:54	+LambdaComplex	hey, openbsd has an eigrpd
2018-09-26 00:54:55	+LambdaComplex	neat
2018-09-26 00:55:00	+LambdaComplex	it also has ospfd and bgpd
2018-09-26 00:55:07	+LambdaComplex	brooks: if you haven't googled it yet, they're routing protocols
2018-09-26 00:55:15	+LambdaComplex	(they're still routing protocols if you did google it btw)
2018-09-26 00:55:25	+brooks	I searched 'em as soon as you named 'em
2018-09-26 00:55:31	+LambdaComplex	oh cool
2018-09-26 00:55:34	+LambdaComplex	what did you learn
2018-09-26 00:56:01	+LambdaComplex	bonus points if you use the word "state machine"
2018-09-26 00:56:03	+brooks	nothing really, both are waaay over my head
2018-09-26 00:56:05	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-26 00:56:09	+LambdaComplex	naaahhhhhhh
2018-09-26 00:56:12	+LambdaComplex	okay bgp maybe
2018-09-26 00:56:17	+LambdaComplex	t. still doesn't understand bgp well enough
2018-09-26 00:56:22	+LambdaComplex	ospf is ez
2018-09-26 00:56:31	+LambdaComplex	at least, configuring it and getting it working
2018-09-26 00:56:44	+LambdaComplex	brooks: do you know what a static route is
2018-09-26 00:57:01	+LambdaComplex	don't overthink this
2018-09-26 00:57:04	+LambdaComplex	it isn't a trick question
2018-09-26 00:57:06	+brooks	yeah?
2018-09-26 00:57:09	+LambdaComplex	>?
2018-09-26 00:57:13	+brooks	I think so
2018-09-26 00:57:19	+LambdaComplex	tell me what a static route is
2018-09-26 00:57:40	+LambdaComplex	feel free to run `ip route show` 
2018-09-26 00:57:48	+brooks	when an IP is statically assigned rather than assigned via a dhcpc server?
2018-09-26 00:57:49	+LambdaComplex	or...`netstat -rn` on openbsd? i think? 
2018-09-26 00:57:59	+brooks	bsd's use netstat still?
2018-09-26 00:58:14	+LambdaComplex	brooks: similar use of the word "static" but not quite
2018-09-26 00:58:23	+LambdaComplex	we're talking about routes, not individual addresses
2018-09-26 00:58:44	+Nux	fuck suse enterprise
2018-09-26 00:58:48	+Nux	literally
2018-09-26 00:58:50	+LambdaComplex	so, let's say you have 3 interfaces, eth0 eth1 eth2
2018-09-26 00:58:53	+Nux	stupidest shit
2018-09-26 00:59:06	+Nux	i have to re synct fucking NTP every restart so ssl shit works
2018-09-26 00:59:18	+Nux	half the time it will say its connected but really isnt
2018-09-26 00:59:19	+LambdaComplex	aaaand let's say that eth1 is connected to the gateway of the 192.168.1.0/24 network
2018-09-26 00:59:23	+Nux	so i cant even sync it
2018-09-26 00:59:27	 *	Cosumu aprehends LambdaComplex
2018-09-26 00:59:35	+LambdaComplex	you could add a static route saying "any traffic destined for 192.168.1.0/24 should go out on eth1"
2018-09-26 00:59:36	+winny	hey
2018-09-26 00:59:38	+winny	any mongodb shills here?
2018-09-26 00:59:45	+Cosumu	yea i will shill it for coin
2018-09-26 00:59:55	+Nux	i will dump it for free
2018-09-26 00:59:57	+Nux	cause super easy
2018-09-26 01:00:25	+LambdaComplex	brooks: but when you have lots of networks, that doesn't work
2018-09-26 01:01:04	+LambdaComplex	brooks: say you've got like 10 routers with 4 ports each and they're cabled together like a spiderweb and each connection is its own /30
2018-09-26 01:01:20	+LambdaComplex	brooks: obviously assigning every single set of networks to every single device is......not a good idea
2018-09-26 01:01:54	+LambdaComplex	brooks: so, with routing protocols, you tell each router "okay, these are the networks you're connected to, now announce them with OSPF" or whatever
2018-09-26 01:02:18	+LambdaComplex	brooks: and they all communicate with OSPF (or whatever protocol) without you having to statically assign the routes

2018-09-26 01:08:37	+Nux	oh it does
2018-09-26 01:08:46	+Nux	and its set on 1024X768
2018-09-26 01:08:54	+Nux	great the tv is in 4:3
2018-09-26 01:09:07	+Nux	and i dont have the remote for this tv
2018-09-26 01:09:13	+Nux	and it only has a physical power button
2018-09-26 01:09:16	+Nux	no others
2018-09-26 01:18:31	+Nux	i just added a resolution, and rebooted

2018-09-26 01:46:26	+LambdaComplex	hm
2018-09-26 01:46:33	+LambdaComplex	apparently the 2 CPUs might be a requirement
2018-09-26 01:47:13	+LambdaComplex	> I see in your VirtualBox configuration, that you assigned only one CPU to the vSRX VM. That's not enough, the vSRX needs two. Without the second one, forwarding doesn't work. I assume the first CPU is for the management of the router and the second for the data transport. As the second is missing, the vSRX can't transport any packets.

2018-09-26 12:48:10	+bdelloid	Kirjava, I considered using that in Opal, but then didn't

2018-09-26 12:49:33	+Kirjava	this is way smarter than how other terminal emulators make you downlaod a terminfo manually
2018-09-26 12:50:56	+bdelloid	I should really refactor cancer
2018-09-26 12:50:59	+bdelloid	it makes me feel bad
2018-09-26 12:51:07	+bdelloid	I still use it as my only terminal tho
2018-09-26 12:51:25	+Kirjava	xcb eh
2018-09-26 12:51:45	+Kirjava	gonna have a poke around with this later

2018-09-26 12:51:58	+bdelloid	probably not
2018-09-26 12:52:02	+Kirjava	I can make it build
2018-09-26 12:52:04	+Kirjava	I have the technology

2018-09-26 12:52:39	+Kirjava	I mean xcb isn't great but that's just because I'm not sure how it could be great
2018-09-26 12:52:58	+bdelloid	xcb is good
2018-09-26 12:53:02	+bdelloid	what would you have used?

2018-09-26 16:01:22	+LambdaComplex	<3
2018-09-26 16:01:39	+Kirjava	brooks: I know. it's criminal
2018-09-26 16:01:47	+Nux	im a criminal
2018-09-26 16:01:48	+LambdaComplex	or brooks is replying to something else
2018-09-26 16:01:54	+Kirjava	root@875cc291ae63:/application# vi
2018-09-26 16:01:54	+Kirjava	bash: vi: command not found
2018-09-26 16:01:57	+LambdaComplex	yeah Nux i bet you littered once
2018-09-26 16:02:01	+Kirjava	^ shouldn't be allowed in this day and age
2018-09-26 16:02:02	+brooks	nope it was the highlight 
2018-09-26 16:02:17	+brooks	Kirjava: literally a violation of POSIX
2018-09-26 16:02:18	+Nux	Kirjava: vim
2018-09-26 16:02:28	+LambdaComplex	brooks: maybe i highlighted (highlit?) you more than once!
2018-09-26 16:02:33	+LambdaComplex	i can't remember these things!
2018-09-26 16:02:39	+Kirjava	I've tried like every text editor
2018-09-26 16:02:41	+brooks	I'm taking you to jail
2018-09-26 16:02:45	+brooks	nix jail
2018-09-26 16:02:49	+Nux	Kirjava: nano
2018-09-26 16:02:52	+Kirjava	do they have vi
2018-09-26 16:02:53	+LambdaComplex	freebsd jail
2018-09-26 16:02:54	+brooks	and rms is gonna feed you foot fungus
2018-09-26 16:03:04	+Kirjava	Nux: 16:02 <+Kirjava> I've tried like every text editor
2018-09-26 16:03:04	+Nux	vim.basic
2018-09-26 16:03:09	+LambdaComplex	brooks: rms ate all of it already
2018-09-26 16:03:18	+brooks	...ok I went too far
2018-09-26 16:03:25	+Kirjava	lmao
2018-09-26 16:03:35	+brooks	LambdaComplex: I'll hold u until equifax is held accountable!
2018-09-26 16:03:41	+Nux	i have a lot of RMS memes
2018-09-26 16:03:43	+trinary	I see nothing wrong with keeping developer tools out of containers
2018-09-26 16:03:55	+Nux	i keep send them to microsoft UK twitters (the only one with open DM's)
2018-09-26 16:04:00	+Nux	they havent responded yet
2018-09-26 16:04:08	+brooks	b-but posix
2018-09-26 16:04:14	+Kirjava	trinary: lack of decent text editor to use inside the container is a problem though
2018-09-26 16:04:15	+LambdaComplex	brooks: well grab a cat and get in bed. we're gonna be here a while
2018-09-26 16:04:17	+Nux	you know what else violates posix
2018-09-26 16:04:20	+trinary	brooks - Which matters why?
2018-09-26 16:04:20	+Nux	darwin
2018-09-26 16:04:23	+Nux	fuck you apple
2018-09-26 16:04:35	+Nux	actually it abides by posix
2018-09-26 16:04:38	+Kirjava	I just did apt-get update && apt-get install vi
2018-09-26 16:04:40	+Nux	its just not certified
2018-09-26 16:04:40	+LambdaComplex	i-isn't darwin literally unix
2018-09-26 16:04:43	+Kirjava	E: Unable to locate package vi
2018-09-26 16:04:43	+trinary	Kirjava - Is it? I can just use the text editor I have installed on the host
2018-09-26 16:04:48	+naught0	> apt-get
2018-09-26 16:04:52	+Nux	LambdaComplex: apple actually developed it
2018-09-26 16:05:01	+Kirjava	naught0: the container is debian - what of it
2018-09-26 16:05:03	+LambdaComplex	Nux: and?
2018-09-26 16:05:11	+LambdaComplex	Nux: OSX is unix
2018-09-26 16:05:13	+naught0	p sure you can just `apt` now
2018-09-26 16:05:14	+Nux	its not posix certified
2018-09-26 16:05:17	+brooks	trinary: it doesn't, I'm joking, but I didn't realize it was deliberate because I didn't read context 
2018-09-26 16:05:22	+naught0	more advanced
2018-09-26 16:05:22	+Kirjava	trinary: sometimes you have to do some work within the container shell
2018-09-26 16:05:31	+trinary	You should never have to
2018-09-26 16:05:32	+Kirjava	and it'd be handy to have some basic tools when you already in there
2018-09-26 16:05:35	+Nux	Kirjava: vim.tiny
2018-09-26 16:05:41	+Nux	visudo
2018-09-26 16:05:52	+Kirjava	Nux: 16:02 <+Kirjava> I've tried like every text editor
2018-09-26 16:05:55	+Nux	vimdot
2018-09-26 16:06:03	+Nux	vimdiff
2018-09-26 16:06:06	+Nux	vim.gtk
2018-09-26 16:06:08	+brooks	Kirjava: mount with sshfs?
2018-09-26 16:06:13	+Kirjava	trinary: what about when you're editing files are aren't exposed to the host
2018-09-26 16:06:23	+trinary	brooks - I hope Kirjavas container has no sshd
2018-09-26 16:06:27	+trinary	That's worse than vim
2018-09-26 16:06:29	+Kirjava	I guess the solution here is 'expose them to the host'
2018-09-26 16:06:37	+naught0	vim.nim
2018-09-26 16:06:42	+Nux	LambdaComplex: i think the main thing why it isnt certified is cause they made it proprietary
2018-09-26 16:06:45	+brooks	how are you operating in the container?
2018-09-26 16:06:48	+Nux	which isnt GPL
2018-09-26 16:06:52	+LambdaComplex	Nux: linux isn't even posix certified
2018-09-26 16:06:54	+LambdaComplex	>:(
2018-09-26 16:06:56	+Nux	true
2018-09-26 16:07:00	+Kirjava	how do you mean operating
2018-09-26 16:07:02	+Nux	but its also not unix
2018-09-26 16:07:10	+brooks	how did you get inside it
2018-09-26 16:07:11	+naught0	ur mum is posix tbh
2018-09-26 16:07:17	+Nux	no
2018-09-26 16:07:20	+Kirjava	docker-compose exec php-fpm bash
2018-09-26 16:07:22	+Nux	shes bat shit insane
2018-09-26 16:07:23	+LambdaComplex	how do you do async io in posix
2018-09-26 16:07:23	+Kirjava	also php is gay etc
2018-09-26 16:07:29	+naught0	is docker bad or not
2018-09-26 16:07:32	+bdelloid	docker-compose suck-my-dick but-also-stab-me-in-the-head
2018-09-26 16:07:33	+naught0	pls make my opinion for me pls ty
2018-09-26 16:07:41	+Nux	fuck docker
2018-09-26 16:07:43	+bdelloid	naught0, it's bad
2018-09-26 16:07:43	+Nux	tbh
2018-09-26 16:07:53	+naught0	ok gr8
2018-09-26 16:07:55	+Nux	depending on the VPS service i use
2018-09-26 16:08:01	+Nux	when i try to make a container
2018-09-26 16:08:08	+Nux	it says "not enough space on disk"
2018-09-26 16:08:15	+bdelloid	Nux, that's not what makes it bad
2018-09-26 16:08:19	+naught0	isn't it platform agnostic bins and schtuff
2018-09-26 16:08:25	+Nux	bdelloid: ik there is a lot more
2018-09-26 16:08:32	+Nux	but thats one my things against it
2018-09-26 16:08:35	+bdelloid	naught0, what?
2018-09-26 16:08:44	+brooks	idk how docker compose works 
2018-09-26 16:08:50	+Nux	i could install debian 9.3 on DO and it will work fine
2018-09-26 16:08:54	+Kirjava	compoose
2018-09-26 16:08:59	+Nux	but deb 9.3 on njal.la
2018-09-26 16:09:01	+Nux	nope
2018-09-26 16:09:01	+brooks	can you just copy a statically compiled bin
2018-09-26 16:09:37	+naught0	oooh I got it confused with that snappackage thing
2018-09-26 16:09:40	+Nux	these njalla boxes have a lot of issues though
2018-09-26 16:09:44	+naught0	or something
2018-09-26 16:09:49	+Nux	i guess thats why they are doing beta tests
2018-09-26 16:09:59	+LambdaComplex	we should just abandon all OSs that aren't Hurd
2018-09-26 16:10:13	+Nux	i literall should be paying $10k USD a year for all the servers i have with them
2018-09-26 16:10:15	+naught0	g'nu m'hurd
2018-09-26 16:10:15	+Nux	lol
2018-09-26 16:10:33	+Kirjava	brooks: yes actually
2018-09-26 16:10:40	+trinary	Kirjava - Check /var/lib/docker/overlay2/*/merged
2018-09-26 16:10:47	+Kirjava	I have to do it each time the container boots but eh
2018-09-26 16:11:19	+Kirjava	overlay2 doesn't exist
2018-09-26 16:11:26	+Kirjava	but I can explore around there I guess
2018-09-26 16:11:29	+trinary	Well, what storage driver are you using?
2018-09-26 16:11:34	+Kirjava	nfi

2018-09-26 16:14:29	+trinary	Kirjava - docker info
2018-09-26 16:14:34	+Nux	thats not gonna cause any stress on your system either
2018-09-26 16:14:46	+Nux	they actually use something similar on normal filters
2018-09-26 16:15:02	+Nux	shit the good filters are thicker than that
2018-09-26 16:15:21	+Nux	 -t ex HVAC distributor
2018-09-26 16:15:49	+Nux	tfw i lost my list of mac addies from thermostats
2018-09-26 16:15:51	+Kirjava	aufs apparentloy
2018-09-26 16:15:55	+Kirjava	so I use that in the path instead
2018-09-26 16:16:09	+Nux	for some reason those wireless thermostats have the mac addy printed on the box
2018-09-26 16:16:15	+Nux	so i wrote them down
2018-09-26 16:16:19	+Nux	to use as spoofs
2018-09-26 16:16:37	+Nux	"why is the thermostat mapping our lan" -t starbucks sysadmin
2018-09-26 16:17:04	+LambdaComplex	w-well you see it's trying to determine the possible sources of heat

2018-09-26 16:41:36	+Nux	and also say "thats gay"
2018-09-26 16:41:38	+naught0	u a trap tho
2018-09-26 16:41:42	+Nux	they dc
2018-09-26 16:41:50	+Nux	its context
2018-09-26 16:41:56	+Nux	C O N T E X T
2018-09-26 16:41:59	+Nux	is key
2018-09-26 16:42:00	+naught0	I'm no fascist but like
2018-09-26 16:42:11	+naught0	Words have power fam
2018-09-26 16:42:18	+Nux	words meaning changes
2018-09-26 16:42:23	+Nux	gay in the 50's meant happy
2018-09-26 16:42:31	+naught0	and now it doot diddly don't
2018-09-26 16:42:35	+brooks	ok trap is harmful 
2018-09-26 16:42:45	+brooks	if you wanna talk about harmful language 
2018-09-26 16:42:53	+Nux	but if they refer to them selves as traps
2018-09-26 16:42:57	+Nux	then whats the harm
2018-09-26 16:43:02	+Nux	if they are ok with it
2018-09-26 16:43:04	+Nux	no harm
2018-09-26 16:43:23	+naught0	well there's a whole conversation to be had about that
2018-09-26 16:43:26	+Nux	you think i ever gave a fuck some one called me a junkie
2018-09-26 16:43:26	+naught0	which I'm ill-equiped to have rn
2018-09-26 16:43:28	+Nux	no
2018-09-26 16:43:44	+Nux	i called myself a junkie
2018-09-26 16:43:55	+trinary	People who are not okay with it might not speak up
2018-09-26 16:43:57	+naught0	problem is the power structures formulated around that language
2018-09-26 16:44:14	+Nux	trinary: p sure when they have trap in their twitter @
2018-09-26 16:44:14	+naught0	like as a white person if I say 'nigger' it has a completely different meaning than if a black person is saying it
2018-09-26 16:44:15	+Nux	they are ok
2018-09-26 16:44:16	+naught0	u feel
2018-09-26 16:44:32	+Nux	naught0: black ppl call me their nigga all the time
2018-09-26 16:44:33	+naught0	#notalltraps
2018-09-26 16:44:35	+trinary	Nux - That's not the person I'm concerned about
2018-09-26 16:44:44	+naught0	Nux: sure that's their prerogative or whatever the spelling
2018-09-26 16:44:58	+naught0	But the context / meaning changes when coming from you or I
2018-09-26 16:44:58	+Nux	perogative
2018-09-26 16:45:06	+naught0	prereerere
2018-09-26 16:45:19	+Nux	naught0: yes exactly, but the context isnt hateful

2018-09-26 16:45:27	+meep	"Tiffany Tumbles | ContraPoints"
2018-09-26 16:45:50	+Nux	its also like, when you say the word bitch to an inaniment object, or anything "like oh this is such a bitch"
2018-09-26 16:46:05	+Nux	you arent calling a girl a bitch, nor or you referring to a dog
2018-09-26 16:46:10	+naught0	I think it's naive to say that words taken from their original context can't be harmful
2018-09-26 16:46:11	+Nux	its context
2018-09-26 16:46:19	+Nux	like, nigga what

2018-09-26 16:47:28	+naught0	You think that's what it's about
2018-09-26 16:47:49	+Nux	and ya saying something is retarded
2018-09-26 16:48:03	+Nux	is diff than telling some one that is actually retarded that they are retarded

2018-09-26 16:48:41	+naught0	You don't think that using the same word to describe objects / things you think are annoying/stupid/etc is at all demeaning?
2018-09-26 16:48:46	+Nux	do i care about all the aspie jokes
2018-09-26 16:48:48	+Nux	no

2018-09-26 16:49:03	+brooks	you're using the social context of the word retarded as referring to, whatever the pc term is, someone mentally handicapped or whatever
2018-09-26 16:49:05	+Nux	naught0: no not at all
2018-09-26 16:49:06	+naught0	This is all anecdotal
2018-09-26 16:49:14	+Nux	words meanings are interchangeable
2018-09-26 16:49:17	+brooks	if it didn't mean that it wouldn't be used

2018-09-26 16:50:08	+Nux	niggers actual definition is "scum of the world"
2018-09-26 16:50:10	+trinary	Nux - Do you think that using "gay" as a universal insult to non-homosexuals doesn't bother a single closeted actual homosexual?
2018-09-26 16:50:13	+Nux	it doesnt mean black ppl
2018-09-26 16:50:25	+naught0	according to who lol
2018-09-26 16:50:29	+Nux	trinary: thats their own personal issue
2018-09-26 16:50:31	+naught0	This is America, guess how it was used 
2018-09-26 16:50:39	+brooks	its usage has changed, definitions are social
2018-09-26 16:50:51	+Nux	i dont think the ppl that can handle that being said, should have to conform to joe blow getting offended
2018-09-26 16:50:55	+trinary	Nux - And who's contributing to the existence of that issue?
2018-09-26 16:51:04	+naught0	Do you think being nice isn't virtuous or the right thing to do?
2018-09-26 16:51:19	+Nux	trinary: the internet
2018-09-26 16:51:22	+naught0	Like how horribly does it affect people to just not say things that are inherently offensive
2018-09-26 16:51:25	+brooks	I think that. I'm coming out as Linus 
2018-09-26 16:51:35	+naught0	RIP
2018-09-26 16:51:59	+naught0	Also calling people "pussies" is reinforcing the gender binary and reinforcing harmful stereotypes :~)
2018-09-26 16:52:02	+naught0	toxic masculinity :~)
2018-09-26 16:52:12	+naught0	ok off my soapbox now

2018-09-26 16:52:24	+Nux	also i think that in comedy, it should still be allowed, esp when comedians make fun of everyone
2018-09-26 16:52:49	+Nux	naught0: i really hope you are trolling
2018-09-26 16:52:55	+brooks	oh I don't think word usage can be divorced from context 
2018-09-26 16:53:01	+Nux	modern feminism is actually a huge threat to women
2018-09-26 16:53:03	+Nux	js
2018-09-26 16:53:07	+brooks	but I don't think bitch and retarded are separated from context

2018-09-26 16:53:47	+naught0	But the ideas I agree with to an extent
2018-09-26 16:53:54	+naught0	Not to the extent of any official censorship tho
2018-09-26 16:54:01	+Nux	also its gone to far with the fucking "remove slave/master terms from IT" "and blacklist/whitelist"
2018-09-26 16:54:03	+naught0	Toxic masculinity is ~le harmful~
2018-09-26 16:54:05	+Nux	thats too fucking far
2018-09-26 16:54:09	+Nux	im srry
2018-09-26 16:54:20	+naught0	haha never thought about blacklist/whitelist
2018-09-26 16:54:24	+Nux	see the context there is slave-HDD master-HDD
2018-09-26 16:54:30	+Nux	not fucking ppl
2018-09-26 16:54:33	+naught0	wonder if that has its actual roots in race
2018-09-26 16:54:34	+Nux	you sensitive fucks

2018-09-26 16:56:43	+brooks	I'm not offended by any of this stuff but I think the way we use words and phrases matters
2018-09-26 16:56:53	+brooks	not particularly bothered on a personal level 
2018-09-26 16:56:56	+Nux	could you imagine late 90's eminem putting out an album rn as a new artist
2018-09-26 16:57:42	+brooks	we have gotten more sensitive, I don't disagree with that
2018-09-26 16:58:05	+brooks	but I don't think word usage is only important because people are too weak

2018-09-26 16:59:36	+Nux	im just saying
2018-09-26 16:59:36	+naught0	what's the point tho Nux 
2018-09-26 16:59:40	+brooks	I don't think it'd have been the worst thing for him to have had to confront this when he was younger
2018-09-26 16:59:42	+Nux	imagine him trying to put that out now
2018-09-26 16:59:42	+brooks	instead of later
2018-09-26 16:59:47	+Nux	back then no one cared

2018-09-26 17:00:00	+naught0	Because society didn't accept gays/trans people? lol
2018-09-26 17:00:08	+brooks	yeah

2018-09-26 17:00:16	+brooks	eminem has a structural advantage
2018-09-26 17:00:18	+naught0	it was seriously offensive when I watched it all back
2018-09-26 17:00:23	+brooks	that let him get away with shit
2018-09-26 17:00:26	+Nux	plus the fact hes white
2018-09-26 17:00:27	+naught0	like why would you disparage anyone like that
2018-09-26 17:00:29	+brooks	lets*
2018-09-26 17:00:29	+Nux	omg
2018-09-26 17:00:41	+brooks	oh, no I did mean let
2018-09-26 17:00:43	+brooks	but yeah
2018-09-26 17:00:59	+brooks	I'm saying there are reasons other than "people are sensitive" to think about word usage
2018-09-26 17:01:09	+brooks	but like otoh I don't care and I'm not gonna police your language
2018-09-26 17:01:09	+Nux	like
2018-09-26 17:01:22	+brooks	I just would prefer if you agreed
2018-09-26 17:01:38	+Nux	no i mean what do you think is other reasons
2018-09-26 17:01:45	+naught0	"sticks n' stones" is a really weak defense of harmful language tbh
2018-09-26 17:02:17	+naught0	I 'member back in the good ol' days when the minorities and gays knew their place and didn't question rampant discriminatory language in popular media

2018-09-26 17:02:46	+naught0	:(
2018-09-26 17:02:55	+brooks	for example
2018-09-26 17:03:05	+naught0	I don't think you're a bad person for using that lanugage Nux to be clear
2018-09-26 17:03:07	+Nux	naught0: cause homie dont play that homophobia shit
2018-09-26 17:03:13	+brooks	you bet your ass there are trans and gay people who grew up listening to eminem in the 90s
2018-09-26 17:03:22	+Nux	yup
2018-09-26 17:03:30	+brooks	and then had to deal with the reality that a rapper they liked said he fucking hated them
2018-09-26 17:03:45	+naught0	Plus a lot of the language had this implicit edge which implied it was a choice 
2018-09-26 17:03:53	+naught0	eaiser to hate someone and put them down when you think it was a choice u feel
2018-09-26 17:04:01	+brooks	like, that's not sensitivity, that's gonna fuck with your sense of who you are and your self-acceptance
2018-09-26 17:04:01	+Nux	also funny there are rumors that dr dre likes traps
2018-09-26 17:04:04	+brooks	you're a teenager

2018-09-26 17:04:48	+naught0	man up
2018-09-26 17:05:06	+Nux	we stopped to get gas, and some redneck big ass dude, said "oh ya the niggers get all the nice things now"

2018-09-26 17:10:12	+naught0	this was like 2 yrs ago
2018-09-26 17:10:13	+Nux	inspect it still tho
2018-09-26 17:10:30	+Nux	slavage yards can save you thousands
2018-09-26 17:10:34	+naught0	I just need to pawn it off to some sucker and get myself an old ass acura / honda
2018-09-26 17:10:42	+Nux	ill buy it
2018-09-26 17:10:53	+LambdaComplex	brooks: one of my coworkers has a linguistics degree and it throws him off
2018-09-26 17:10:54	+naught0	I actually drove it to NC And back to south FL with no issues
2018-09-26 17:10:57	+naught0	not a bad car
2018-09-26 17:11:00	+Nux	what year is it
2018-09-26 17:11:05	+LambdaComplex	brooks: because i have no southern accent but i still talk like a southerner
2018-09-26 17:11:05	+Nux	and model
2018-09-26 17:11:16	+brooks	he's a bad linguist!
2018-09-26 17:11:17	+Nux	i have 0 accent at all
2018-09-26 17:11:17	+naught0	'03 A4 4WD and a 3.2litre engine or something
2018-09-26 17:11:20	+LambdaComplex	brooks: like dropping infinitives e.g. "the car needs washed" vs "the car needs to be washed"
2018-09-26 17:11:22	+Nux	unless i get really mad
2018-09-26 17:11:24	+brooks	this is the best part of linguistics!
2018-09-26 17:11:25	+Nux	then i sound ghetto af
2018-09-26 17:11:31	+LambdaComplex	yeah yeah i tell him prescriptive linguistics is inherently classist like 20 times a week
2018-09-26 17:11:38	+brooks	kek
2018-09-26 17:11:38	+naught0	I accidentally take people's accents when I talk to them :(
2018-09-26 17:11:47	+brooks	I don't mean he's a harmful linguist!
2018-09-26 17:11:51	+Nux	naught0: lol dont go to chalmette then
2018-09-26 17:11:57	+brooks	I mean he ain't enjoyin the skills right!

2018-09-26 17:18:40	+naught0	brooks: how goes ur glorious revolution
2018-09-26 17:18:53	+brooks	actually it went pretty okay
2018-09-26 17:19:05	+brooks	their record with gay people is terrible, but so is everyone else's
2018-09-26 17:19:27	+brooks	cuba is the only country considered environmentally sustainable, and they've been thriving for years despite the US's efforts to choke them to death
2018-09-26 17:19:40	+brooks	it's only relatively recently starting to go downhill
2018-09-26 17:20:40	+naught0	yeah whatever you say you north korea sympathizer
2018-09-26 17:20:45	+naught0	say hi to stalin in HE'LL !
2018-09-26 17:20:49	+naught0	commie sCUM
2018-09-26 17:20:52	+brooks	there's this one interview I read recently
2018-09-26 17:20:56	+brooks	or not interview but
2018-09-26 17:20:58	+brooks	writeup
2018-09-26 17:21:02	+brooks	this dude spent some time in cuba
2018-09-26 17:21:12	+brooks	and he said someone asked him why he wore glasses instead of getting lasik
2018-09-26 17:21:23	+brooks	and he was like I can't afford lasik
2018-09-26 17:21:32	+brooks	them: ? why don't you just petition the govt to cover it
2018-09-26 17:22:02	+brooks	they have, I think? the highest number of doctors per person of any other country
2018-09-26 17:22:14	+brooks	and they send doctors in to do aid in crises regularly
2018-09-26 17:22:36	+naught0	yeah but they operate out of taxis and briefcases with rust sporks as instruments of surgery
2018-09-26 17:22:43	+brooks	kek
2018-09-26 17:22:46	+naught0	lasik entails flashing an oldtimey flashlight several times in ur face
2018-09-26 17:22:47	+brooks	nah
2018-09-26 17:22:53	+brooks	there's an exodus rn where younger people are leaving the country for greener pastures
2018-09-26 17:22:56	+naught0	then castro spits on u
2018-09-26 17:22:59	+naught0	bam ur cured
2018-09-26 17:23:04	+brooks	but a big percentage is actually going back
2018-09-26 17:23:10	+brooks	once they realize it's fucked outside
2018-09-26 17:23:46	+naught0	feel like that's how I would feel if I left the US tbh
2018-09-26 17:23:54	+naught0	as much as I dislike its politics much of the time
2018-09-26 17:23:56	+brooks	I doubt it tbh
2018-09-26 17:24:06	+naught0	everywhere's got problems
2018-09-26 17:25:46	+naught0	mo money mo problems amirite

2018-09-26 19:00:39	+aesthetik	psst, i have an excersize / question for you guys
2018-09-26 19:00:57	+dysfigured	leggo
2018-09-26 19:01:08	+aesthetik	my boss is being a dick and saying something I wrote poses a security risk, i was hoping I could describe the system and you guys can tell me if you see any security risks from it?
2018-09-26 19:01:17	+dysfigured	paste it
2018-09-26 19:01:31	+aesthetik	ok one sec i can post the actual code too i guess lol
2018-09-26 19:02:07	+aesthetik	https://gist.github.com/zack6849/f50f6e863a8d950cfec421b2938f6e79
2018-09-26 19:02:14	+LambdaComplex	Arathnim: do tell
2018-09-26 19:02:40	+aesthetik	okay, so, the basic gist is, we have employees who manage products and need us to reindex our product catalog for their changes to show up
2018-09-26 19:02:46	+aesthetik	right now this runs on a 30 minute cronjob
2018-09-26 19:02:52	+dysfigured	i'm just going to review this line by line... var exec = require('child_process').exec;  why the fuck is this var and why didn't you destructure this, do you have a linter installed??
2018-09-26 19:02:59	+aesthetik	but sometimes they need it quicker and have to bother us
2018-09-26 19:03:04	+brooks	what did he say the security risk was
2018-09-26 19:03:07	+aesthetik	dysfigured: no, i have no idea, i just copy pasted it to be honest
2018-09-26 19:03:10	+aesthetik	brooks: i'll get to that
2018-09-26 19:03:12	+dysfigured	>.>
2018-09-26 19:03:14	+aesthetik	shhh
2018-09-26 19:03:22	+aesthetik	i thought maybe there was a reaosn it was a var
2018-09-26 19:03:24	+aesthetik	some node magic idk
2018-09-26 19:03:26	+aesthetik	anyways
2018-09-26 19:03:29	+dysfigured	do you have a linter installed
2018-09-26 19:03:37	+aesthetik	he was complaining about how the code is bad because it uses ssh
2018-09-26 19:03:43	+aesthetik	and anyone on our slack and ssh our servers
2018-09-26 19:03:45	+aesthetik	yadda yadda
2018-09-26 19:03:47	+aesthetik	which is bullshit
2018-09-26 19:03:51	+aesthetik	but my question is
2018-09-26 19:04:03	+aesthetik	the app is installed on a server with no root login, pubkey auth only
2018-09-26 19:04:11	+aesthetik	with unattended updated enabled 
2018-09-26 19:04:20	+aesthetik	and the script runs as a sandboxed user and a systemd service
2018-09-26 19:04:26	+Arathnim	Easter egg in Road to Gehenna. I won't spoil it.
2018-09-26 19:04:39	+aesthetik	so unless you have the private key, theres literally no way i can think of to control the bot outside of from slack
2018-09-26 19:04:54	+aesthetik	and even from slack the bot executes a predetermined, safe, command, on a specific host
2018-09-26 19:05:06	+aesthetik	the host is in a config file which is on the bot's server's filesystem
2018-09-26 19:05:20	+aesthetik	so no direct user input can get in from someone who has no direct fs access
2018-09-26 19:05:25	+dysfigured	looking at it, i understand their gripe
2018-09-26 19:05:25	+aesthetik	he argues this is somehow insecure
2018-09-26 19:05:46	+aesthetik	dysfigured: how's that? he said it should be over http
2018-09-26 19:05:54	+aesthetik	which is far fucking worse as far as I'm concerned
2018-09-26 19:06:30	+dysfigured	yeah i mean if you can do ssh with pubkey auth that's much better than http requests
2018-09-26 19:06:53	+aesthetik	and yes, i am using exec with ssh, but i see no way possible that someone can tamper with this without having fs access
2018-09-26 19:07:10	+dysfigured	i'm just saying, looking at the code,  exec(`ssh ${resolved_host} bin/magento indexer:reindex`)   is an ugly hack and you know it
2018-09-26 19:07:41	+aesthetik	and the alternative is what, using a process builder?
2018-09-26 19:07:46	+dysfigured	especially considering resolved_host is derived from user input
2018-09-26 19:07:54	+aesthetik	dysfigured: not directly but yes
2018-09-26 19:08:02	+aesthetik	the uer input is key value translated
2018-09-26 19:08:07	+aesthetik	eg !reindex prod
2018-09-26 19:08:20	+dysfigured	consider spawn instead of exec
2018-09-26 19:08:22	+aesthetik	turns into ssh someuser@prod.acme.co bin/magento indexer:reindex
2018-09-26 19:08:37	+aesthetik	the actual value it translates to is on the fs
2018-09-26 19:08:40	+naught0	still compiling after 3 hours for those playing at home
2018-09-26 19:08:50	+aesthetik	so direct, unsanitized user input, is not passed to the exec command at any time
2018-09-26 19:09:29	+dysfigured	spawn('ssh', [resolved_host, 'bin/magento', 'indexer:reindex'], callback)
2018-09-26 19:09:41	+aesthetik	so, bearing all that in mind, aside form not using spawn over exec, do you see any reason this code is insecure
2018-09-26 19:09:45	+aesthetik	because his logic is
2018-09-26 19:09:50	+aesthetik	we should rewrite it as a magento module
2018-09-26 19:10:02	+aesthetik	it's 55 lines of js that he wants to turn into several hundred lines of php
2018-09-26 19:10:03	+dysfigured	idk wtf magento is
2018-09-26 19:10:05	+aesthetik	for literally no reason
2018-09-26 19:10:09	+aesthetik	an ecommerce system
2018-09-26 19:10:27	+aesthetik	he wants something that would essentially be a bot that joins slack from the environment and then joins slack
2018-09-26 19:10:33	+aesthetik	so instead of one slack controlling several hosts
2018-09-26 19:10:41	+aesthetik	he wants serveral bots each controlling one
2018-09-26 19:10:47	+aesthetik	which, to me, seems fucking retarded
2018-09-26 19:11:00	+aesthetik	and his arguent that ssh is insecure was laughable to me
2018-09-26 19:11:13	+trinary	aesthetik - He does have a point
2018-09-26 19:11:18	+aesthetik	trinary: about what, exact
2018-09-26 19:11:21	+aesthetik	exctly**
2018-09-26 19:11:44	<--	xDemonessx (~Shiro@kick.punch.block) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2018-09-26 19:12:01	+trinary	aesthetik - Right now, your bot has more power than it needs to have. You could restrict the magento server to only allow you to execute one specific script. A script you wrote on the magento server to execute just your command, nothing else
2018-09-26 19:12:26	+trinary	aesthetik - That way, even if your bots credentials are leaked, all an attacker can do is re-index quickly
2018-09-26 19:13:01	+aesthetik	trinary: but th ebot is only configured to run one command and the likleyhook of someone getting their hands on the privkey and sshing into our systems are pretty unlikley
2018-09-26 19:13:10	+trinary	That's not the point
2018-09-26 19:13:18	+trinary	It could be made more secure
2018-09-26 19:13:36	+trinary	You want ForceCommand in sshd_config
2018-09-26 19:13:39	+aesthetik	so you think it'd be better to write a script that we deploy to all our servers that the bot calls somehow but only has access to that main thing?
2018-09-26 19:13:55	+aesthetik	trinary: not possible
2018-09-26 19:14:11	+trinary	Too bad
2018-09-26 19:14:20	+aesthetik	the user the bot logs in as has to be able to run other commands
2018-09-26 19:14:50	+trinary	And you can't have the bot log in as another user?
2018-09-26 19:14:52	+brooks	why not give it its own user?

2018-09-26 19:15:01	+aesthetik	brooks: we dont have root access on those servers
2018-09-26 19:15:05	+aesthetik	and have no control of that environment
2018-09-26 19:15:07	+aesthetik	so no
2018-09-26 19:15:14	+aesthetik	and in fact, the filesystem it sshs into is readonly
2018-09-26 19:15:22	+aesthetik	so
2018-09-26 19:15:24	+brooks	how are you putting the bot there
2018-09-26 19:15:34	+aesthetik	brooks: it's not on the server magento is on
2018-09-26 19:15:37	+aesthetik	it's on a seperate one
2018-09-26 19:15:51	+aesthetik	the magento server user we have access to has readonly filesystem access
2018-09-26 19:16:01	+trinary	aesthetik - It sounds like you want to hear "everything is fine"
2018-09-26 19:16:17	+trinary	I only explained what I think your boss meant
2018-09-26 19:16:21	+trinary	Do with that what you want
2018-09-26 19:17:02	+aesthetik	trinary: I very much doubt this since he has not seen the code, and blindly assumed things. he's pissy because the project manager asked me to do it and it didn't go directly through him

2018-09-26 19:17:37	+aesthetik	and no, you're right, it could be more secure, but my point was, there are no obvious security holes that lead to exploits sans someone comprimising the private keys
2018-09-26 19:17:48	+trinary	But blanket ssh login *is* more insecure than his http server
2018-09-26 19:18:00	+brooks	^
2018-09-26 19:18:17	+aesthetik	so the php script to do this, how would that work
2018-09-26 19:18:21	+aesthetik	run a local system command?
2018-09-26 19:18:37	+aesthetik	what if someone comprimises the keys to that server or our git deployment process
2018-09-26 19:18:41	+aesthetik	and changes the file or the commands
2018-09-26 19:18:43	+trinary	It would have to be on the magento server, yes
2018-09-26 19:18:51	+trinary	Then you're screwed either way
2018-09-26 19:19:01	+aesthetik	you'd just be moving the same theoretical exploit of running an unwanted command to a different host
2018-09-26 19:19:38	+trinary	Yes, and that makes it more secure
2018-09-26 19:19:50	+trinary	In one scenario you lose two servers, in the other just one
2018-09-26 19:20:05	+trinary	Not knowing any details or what other tasks those servers do, that's the best I can do
2018-09-26 19:20:46	+aesthetik	but again that's all contingent on someone breaking into the server that hs privkey only logins, which doesnt seem likley
2018-09-26 19:21:06	+Leliana	less likely things have happened
2018-09-26 19:21:09	+Leliana	like aesthetik having sex
2018-09-26 19:21:10	+trinary	I agree. Your bot isn't horribly insecure, but that was never the premise
2018-09-26 19:21:14	+Leliana	[zimbabwe]
2018-09-26 19:21:23	+aesthetik	Leliana: r u d e
2018-09-26 19:21:39	+aesthetik	trinary: perhaps to you, but it was to him
2018-09-26 19:22:01	+aesthetik	he's going to have a meeting about it today and im expecting him to try and tell the CEO that my bot is wildy insecure and the project should be canned
2018-09-26 19:22:10	+trinary	And you should always plan for the case where one security measure can be circumvented
2018-09-26 19:22:11	+aesthetik	at this point the project has been completed and approved by the ceo twice 
2018-09-26 19:22:36	+aesthetik	and when it got to the stge where he had to grant ssh access to a server he got pissy and said it's insecure yadda yadda
2018-09-26 19:22:53	+aesthetik	and wants to put the code under a microscope and a review process with the entire department and get it approved a third time
2018-09-26 19:23:10	+aesthetik	whcih to me, seems a lot more like he's just trying to get it cancelled / delayed
2018-09-26 19:23:35	+aesthetik	this 55 lines of js took me an hour and we've spent more time than that trying to get him to give ssh access to something to make several people's jobs easier
2018-09-26 19:24:40	+trinary	What is your, and what is his position?
2018-09-26 19:24:52	+aesthetik	I'm a "junior" magento developer
2018-09-26 19:25:07	+aesthetik	he is the senior developer, though I don't necessarily agree with that title
2018-09-26 19:25:54	+trinary	I can understand his caution about handing out blanket ssh access. To anyone

2018-09-26 19:30:30	+aesthetik	right
2018-09-26 19:31:41	+trinary	Anything that has trivial access to prod needs to be secured like prod
2018-09-26 19:32:01	+trinary	And of course you want to keep the installations to secure as few as possible

2018-09-26 19:43:54	+trinary	You have a single gcc call that's taking too long?
2018-09-26 19:45:28	+naught0	well I'm compiling linux
2018-09-26 19:45:40	+naught0	I wish it had a progressbar >:(
2018-09-26 19:45:56	+trinary	Only takes a minute or two, just wait it out
2018-09-26 19:46:45	+naught0	well my last one took 3 hours and wasn't done yet
2018-09-26 19:46:56	+trinary	How did you manage to achieve that?
2018-09-26 19:47:08	+naught0	well it's a chromebook but I have no other answers
2018-09-26 19:47:32	+naught0	I did the uh make localmodconfig thing this time
2018-09-26 19:47:36	+naught0	so hopefully that's a lot faster
2018-09-26 19:49:47	+trinary	I just timed a clean compilation, including unpacking of source and configuring: 79s
2018-09-26 19:50:04	+naught0	did you `make localmodconfig`
2018-09-26 19:50:06	+naught0	also specs?
2018-09-26 19:50:09	+trinary	Now sure, your kernel may have more things enabled, and a chromebook would be slower, but 3h...
2018-09-26 19:51:21	+naught0	well we're going on 5 minutes now or so
2018-09-26 19:51:23	+trinary	It is a fairly small config, manual config. Laptop with some i7
2018-09-26 19:51:27	+naught0	we'll see how it goes without literally everything enabled
2018-09-26 19:59:31	+naught0	looks like I've got like 2k things uncommented in the config
2018-09-26 19:59:40	+naught0	though how I counted that is highly suspect
2018-09-26 20:00:37	+trinary	I have 278 with =y

2018-09-26 20:13:23	+naught0	but no precompiled thing exist so I had to do it myself
2018-09-26 20:13:37	+bdelloid	are those two options for modules
2018-09-26 20:13:43	+bdelloid	if they are you can just build the modules with the options enabled

2018-09-26 20:15:45	+bdelloid	I just don't know what the module is called, so it's easier to let udev do its thing
2018-09-26 20:15:50	+bdelloid	or whatever else is taking care of it

2018-09-26 20:16:09	+naught0	dunno why the module is default disabled
2018-09-26 20:16:27	+bdelloid	might be a staging module

2018-09-27 01:13:33	+brooks	oh shit you should really go to sleep @ 8
2018-09-27 01:13:35	+brooks	;^)
2018-09-27 01:13:49	+LambdaComplex	ya think?
2018-09-27 01:13:53	+brooks	I really hate xkcd
2018-09-27 01:14:00	+LambdaComplex	why
2018-09-27 01:14:06	+brooks	it's like 80% smug bullshit
2018-09-27 01:14:15	+brooks	and only 40% of that is smug bullshit I can enjoy
2018-09-27 01:14:28	+brooks	so as u can see by these numbers I only enjoy about 60% of it
2018-09-27 01:14:30	+brooks	actually
2018-09-27 01:14:34	+brooks	that's wrong it's definitely 40%
2018-09-27 01:14:40	+brooks	wonder how I messed up the initial numbers
2018-09-27 01:14:54	+brooks	like look @ this
2018-09-27 01:15:01	+brooks	https://xkcd.com/2051
2018-09-27 01:15:12	+LambdaComplex	kek
2018-09-27 01:15:18	+LambdaComplex	y-you do get the reference, right?
2018-09-27 01:15:40	+LambdaComplex	brooks: r-right?
2018-09-27 01:15:52	+brooks	uh
2018-09-27 01:15:54	+brooks	which
2018-09-27 01:15:56	+brooks	probably not
2018-09-27 01:16:00	+LambdaComplex	https://xkcd.com/386/
2018-09-27 01:16:05	+LambdaComplex	it's very definitely a callback to this one
2018-09-27 01:16:16	+brooks	oh, yeah
2018-09-27 01:16:31	+brooks	I'm familiar with that one but I didn't think about it as a callback
2018-09-27 01:16:32	+LambdaComplex	except instead of finding someone wrong on the internet it's _looking for people_ who are wrong on the internet
2018-09-27 01:16:40	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-27 01:17:08	+LambdaComplex	i'd even go so far as to suggest it may be a reference to the shift in the political climate/online discourse/etc. since then
2018-09-27 01:17:19	+brooks	that's the part that annoys me
2018-09-27 01:17:20	+LambdaComplex	asking the reader to look at how things have changed over the last several years
2018-09-27 01:17:24	+LambdaComplex	brooks: which part
2018-09-27 01:17:33	+LambdaComplex	i just said like 100 words and i know what at least 3 of them mean
2018-09-27 01:17:34	+brooks	"everyone is so sensitive and always looking for an excuse to be mad, look how ridiculous this is!"
2018-09-27 01:18:00	+brooks	boring take, smug delivery, par for the course

2018-09-27 10:02:05	+workodera	it was about this "woman" breaking her own code of conduct

2018-09-27 10:03:41	+workodera	then some guy linked to "coraline" asking some guy the be banished from his project for a tweet he made on his own personal twitter

2018-09-27 10:05:00	+Kirjava	I disagree.

2018-09-27 10:09:42	+workodera	they want more "diversity" in linux to the point of being against meritocracy. Yet all we get is old men dressed up as little girls
2018-09-27 10:10:17	+jenkins	going against meritocracy is actually the whole point
2018-09-27 10:55:06	+Kirjava	I think we can trust linus to be level headed enough to defend against this kind of nonsense if it affects the code quality of the linux kernel though
2018-09-27 10:57:00	+Kirjava	I assume he simply adopted a CoC because he thought the language he uses is off putting to some people and may be a detriment to the code
2018-09-27 10:57:37	+Kirjava	if he sees the CoC start to be used to oust members of the team that contribute solid work for reasons completely related to the project, can I see that being shot down real fast

2018-09-27 14:41:56	+aesthetik	product feeds, probably.
2018-09-27 14:42:13	+aesthetik	eg: integration to feed your product catalog to things like google merchant center
2018-09-27 14:42:24	+aesthetik	and advertise your product
2018-09-27 14:42:34	+aesthetik	could also mean an RSS feed i suppose
2018-09-27 14:42:44	+aesthetik	either of those sound about right for the context, LambdaComplex ?
2018-09-27 14:42:53	+LambdaComplex	lol i have literally no idea
2018-09-27 14:43:09	+LambdaComplex	i was just checking a server that _might_ be running magento and there was a dir named "feeds"

2018-09-27 14:43:55	+aesthetik	ours just generated an xml file and we fed that to google

2018-09-28 01:15:31	+LambdaComplex	i.e. talking to my vSRX VMs
2018-09-28 01:18:14	+LambdaComplex	brooks: mfw freebsd doesn't use hostname.if files :(
2018-09-28 01:21:52	+LambdaComplex	alright, let's see if configuring this openbsd vm the same way i did the vSRX vms works
2018-09-28 01:22:20	+LambdaComplex	well, it has 8 interfaces
2018-09-28 01:22:22	+LambdaComplex	sweet
2018-09-28 01:22:24	+LambdaComplex	>vio0
2018-09-28 01:22:30	 *	LambdaComplex runs `man vio`
2018-09-28 01:22:44	+LambdaComplex	neat
2018-09-28 01:25:13	+LambdaComplex	brooks: did you see my openbsd config repo
2018-09-28 01:27:13	+LambdaComplex	aaaaand now i have openbsd pinging junos
2018-09-28 01:27:16	+LambdaComplex	progress!
2018-09-28 01:28:17	+LambdaComplex	so, openbsd------vSRX1-------vSRX2
2018-09-28 01:28:19	+LambdaComplex	hmmmmmm
2018-09-28 01:28:49	+LambdaComplex	alright i'll enable ospf on vSRX1 and have it redistribute the static route to vSRX2
2018-09-28 01:29:04	+LambdaComplex	then i'll need to get ospfd on openbsd working so that it can receive the route
2018-09-28 01:31:13	+LambdaComplex	alright i need to look up how to set ospf to redistribute a static route
2018-09-28 01:31:16	+LambdaComplex	because icr
2018-09-28 01:33:20	+winny	LambdaComplex: hey bradda
2018-09-28 01:34:02	+winny	LambdaComplex: u installing open butt sex daily on hw?
2018-09-28 01:34:08	+LambdaComplex	shit that isn't even a static route i don't think
2018-09-28 01:34:10	+LambdaComplex	uhhhhhh
2018-09-28 01:34:17	+LambdaComplex	wait
2018-09-28 01:34:25	+LambdaComplex	do i even have that interface configured
2018-09-28 01:34:42	+LambdaComplex	oh good lord i don't
2018-09-28 01:34:45	+LambdaComplex	smh
2018-09-28 01:34:50	+LambdaComplex	LambdaComplex: stop clearing your damn configs so much
2018-09-28 01:35:28	+winny	LambdaComplex: thoughts on openbsd?
2018-09-28 01:36:04	+LambdaComplex	winny: still don't think i'd use it as a daily driver but for this shit it's comfy af
2018-09-28 01:36:18	+winny	what u using it for?
2018-09-28 01:36:28	+LambdaComplex	routing
2018-09-28 01:36:48	+LambdaComplex	hey it's redistributing the route now
2018-09-28 01:36:50	+LambdaComplex	sweet
2018-09-28 01:37:21	+mobo	layer 3 is a meme
2018-09-28 01:37:28	+LambdaComplex	mobo: ...what
2018-09-28 01:37:38	+mobo	idk, you mentioned routing
2018-09-28 01:37:41	+mobo	that was my response 
2018-09-28 01:38:06	+winny	LambdaComplex: i lov u man u represent my spirit animal
2018-09-28 01:38:19	+LambdaComplex	winny: was that the right answer wrt openbsd?
2018-09-28 01:38:30	+winny	yes
2018-09-28 01:38:34	+LambdaComplex	:3
2018-09-28 01:38:46	+LambdaComplex	i'm gonna go to bed soon
2018-09-28 01:38:51	+LambdaComplex	got the junos shit configured
2018-09-28 01:38:58	+LambdaComplex	just need to do ospfd on the openbsd side
2018-09-28 01:38:59	+mobo	I love junos
2018-09-28 01:39:01	+mobo	we use it at work
2018-09-28 01:39:05	+LambdaComplex	same
2018-09-28 01:39:07	+LambdaComplex	have you used ios?
2018-09-28 01:39:15	+mobo	at school I have
2018-09-28 01:39:19	+mobo	not at a company
2018-09-28 01:39:23	+LambdaComplex	junos is so much better
2018-09-28 01:39:26	+mobo	true
2018-09-28 01:39:33	+mobo	I prefer it b/c it has that freebsd backend
2018-09-28 01:39:36	+mobo	login to a shell
2018-09-28 01:39:40	+LambdaComplex	that's part of it for sure
2018-09-28 01:39:47	+LambdaComplex	also the config
2018-09-28 01:39:50	+LambdaComplex	like
2018-09-28 01:39:53	+mobo	yeah, the config is sexy
2018-09-28 01:39:54	+LambdaComplex	the hierarchy
2018-09-28 01:39:57	+mobo	mhm
2018-09-28 01:39:58	+LambdaComplex	vs IOS's.....
2018-09-28 01:39:59	+winny	freebsd is objectively better
2018-09-28 01:40:01	+LambdaComplex	yeah
2018-09-28 01:40:03	+LambdaComplex	you know
2018-09-28 01:40:05	+LambdaComplex	ew
2018-09-28 01:40:09	+winny	i take freebsd over openbsd any day tbh
2018-09-28 01:40:17	+LambdaComplex	winny: why's that
2018-09-28 01:40:18	+mobo	I use openbsd on my laptop at work
2018-09-28 01:40:23	+winny	oh what
2018-09-28 01:40:23	+mobo	it's okay
2018-09-28 01:40:28	+winny	mobo: what do u use your work laptop for?
2018-09-28 01:40:28	+LambdaComplex	also junos has so much shit on top of freebsd that that's kinda irrelevant anyways
2018-09-28 01:40:41	+mobo	winny: mostly network testing and serial connections
2018-09-28 01:40:46	+LambdaComplex	but the fact that you have root access to the fs and a real shell is nice
2018-09-28 01:40:59	+mobo	ya
2018-09-28 01:40:59	+LambdaComplex	mobo: i passed my jncia-junos exam today :3
2018-09-28 01:41:02	+mobo	nice!
2018-09-28 01:41:05	+LambdaComplex	ty
2018-09-28 01:41:26	+mobo	only complaint against juniper was that we got a batch of switches that would randomly kernel panic
2018-09-28 01:41:31	+mobo	and they were production too
2018-09-28 01:41:33	+LambdaComplex	ouch
2018-09-28 01:41:36	+mobo	yeh
2018-09-28 01:41:43	+LambdaComplex	did you reinstall the os?
2018-09-28 01:41:49	+mobo	yeah, it was a hardware issue
2018-09-28 01:41:56	+LambdaComplex	ah
2018-09-28 01:41:57	+mobo	can't remember exactly what
2018-09-28 01:41:59	+LambdaComplex	rip in peace
2018-09-28 01:42:09	+mobo	sent those bitches back
2018-09-28 01:42:11	+LambdaComplex	...what do yo ueven do for work
2018-09-28 01:42:14	+LambdaComplex	also what kind of switches were they
2018-09-28 01:42:23	+mobo	I'm a sysadmin at an embedded systems company
2018-09-28 01:42:27	+mobo	juniper ex4300s
2018-09-28 01:42:28	+LambdaComplex	nice
2018-09-28 01:42:33	+winny	mobo: sounds painful
2018-09-28 01:42:36	+winny	do u like it
2018-09-28 01:42:36	+LambdaComplex	is that like the ex4200?
2018-09-28 01:42:39	+mobo	I do like it
2018-09-28 01:42:41	+LambdaComplex	we have a fuckton of ex4200s in prod
2018-09-28 01:42:42	+winny	nice
2018-09-28 01:42:45	+mobo	er, maybe I mean a 4200
2018-09-28 01:42:52	+winny	i've worked as sysadmin and found i really hate it
2018-09-28 01:42:58	+mobo	no, I mean 4300
2018-09-28 01:43:02	+winny	i felt like the company bitch
2018-09-28 01:43:02	+mobo	yeah I love it winny 
2018-09-28 01:43:05	+mobo	the company is great
2018-09-28 01:43:05	+LambdaComplex	uhhh
2018-09-28 01:43:06	+LambdaComplex	https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/switching/ex-series/ex4300/
2018-09-28 01:43:09	+LambdaComplex	that?
2018-09-28 01:43:10	+LambdaComplex	they look different for sure
2018-09-28 01:43:12	+mobo	https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/switching/ex-series/ex4300/
2018-09-28 01:43:14	+mobo	yeah
2018-09-28 01:43:24	+mobo	they're nice
2018-09-28 01:43:35	 *	LambdaComplex plugs an SFP+ into mobo
2018-09-28 01:43:40	+LambdaComplex	gottagofast
2018-09-28 01:43:45	+mobo	hot
2018-09-28 01:44:33	+mobo	we're all layer 2
2018-09-28 01:44:36	+mobo	which is weird
2018-09-28 01:44:46	+LambdaComplex	wdym
2018-09-28 01:44:47	+mobo	our core switches have two 40gbps links
2018-09-28 01:44:53	+mobo	we have no routers on our internal network
2018-09-28 01:44:56	+mobo	just switches
2018-09-28 01:45:18	+LambdaComplex	....is it just one network then?
2018-09-28 01:45:21	+LambdaComplex	no vlans or anything?
2018-09-28 01:45:28	+mobo	no, we have vlans and subnets
2018-09-28 01:45:33	+mobo	switches can handle those
2018-09-28 01:45:52	+LambdaComplex	yeah, layer 3 switches
2018-09-28 01:45:56	+LambdaComplex	i like to call those router :::^)
2018-09-28 01:46:00	+LambdaComplex	*routers
2018-09-28 01:46:01	+mobo	they're not layer 3
2018-09-28 01:46:09	+LambdaComplex	uhhhh
2018-09-28 01:46:11	+mobo	so I guess technically no subnets
2018-09-28 01:46:13	+LambdaComplex	how are you routing between vlans then?
2018-09-28 01:46:19	+mobo	vlans are layer two?
2018-09-28 01:46:20	+LambdaComplex	im confus
2018-09-28 01:46:35	+LambdaComplex	yeah, they are, but you need something to route between them
2018-09-28 01:46:56	+mobo	do you?
2018-09-28 01:47:04	+mobo	idk, it just werks
2018-09-28 01:47:09	+LambdaComplex	well....i guess if you don't need the vlans to talk to each other then you don't.....
2018-09-28 01:47:24	+mobo	we do employ routers to talk to the isolated networks
2018-09-28 01:47:33	+mobo	but those are an entirely different range altogether 
2018-09-28 01:47:45	+LambdaComplex	what's the biggest router you've seen
2018-09-28 01:48:05	+mobo	we don't use expensive routers 
2018-09-28 01:48:08	+mobo	so
2018-09-28 01:48:12	+mobo	a 1u router
2018-09-28 01:48:14	+LambdaComplex	o
2018-09-28 01:48:20	+LambdaComplex	...kek
2018-09-28 01:48:28	+LambdaComplex	i think our core routers are 16U
2018-09-28 01:48:30	+LambdaComplex	lemme check
2018-09-28 01:48:31	+mobo	jeez
2018-09-28 01:48:43	+mobo	our WAN connection is only 100mbps
2018-09-28 01:48:53	+mobo	because 99% of our data is transferred internally
2018-09-28 01:48:56	+LambdaComplex	we're like....technically an ISP
2018-09-28 01:49:00	+mobo	ah
2018-09-28 01:49:04	+mobo	well that makes sense
2018-09-28 01:50:16	+mobo	hmm, kinda drunk
2018-09-28 01:50:21	+mobo	what should I get to eat, #code?
2018-09-28 01:50:22	+LambdaComplex	looks like we're not on the list anymore but at one point we were #7 on hurrican electric's list of most ipv4 adjacencies
2018-09-28 01:50:28	+mobo	damn
2018-09-28 01:50:42	+LambdaComplex	it's a close list though
2018-09-28 01:50:45	+brooks	tacos
2018-09-28 01:50:50	+LambdaComplex	10 through 6 are within a few hundred peers
2018-09-28 01:50:57	+brooks	I want tacos 
2018-09-28 01:51:00	+LambdaComplex	hell, 10 and 9  are like ~30 peers apart
2018-09-28 01:51:03	+mobo	I had mexican food for lunch brooks 
2018-09-28 01:51:07	+brooks	dang
2018-09-28 01:51:08	+mobo	and it was a terrible place
2018-09-28 01:51:09	+LambdaComplex	9 and 8 are 17 peers apart
2018-09-28 01:51:12	+LambdaComplex	kek
2018-09-28 01:51:18	+mobo	it was worse than taco bell
2018-09-28 01:51:22	+brooks	eat better mexican for dinner to make up for it ;^)
2018-09-28 01:51:35	+mobo	I honestly might
2018-09-28 01:51:39	+LambdaComplex	>up to 12 Tbps of system capacity in one-third of a standard telco rack, with support for high-density 10GbE, 40GbE, 100GbE, and 400GbE interfaces, as well as legacy SONET/SDH, ATM, and PDH connectivity.
2018-09-28 01:51:40	+brooks	I've done that before
2018-09-28 01:51:44	+LambdaComplex	mobo: gorgeous, isn't it
2018-09-28 01:51:51	+mobo	damn
2018-09-28 01:51:53	+mobo	impressive
2018-09-28 01:52:00	+LambdaComplex	shit is cash
2018-09-28 01:52:25	+LambdaComplex	mobo: have you done ospf with openbsd
2018-09-28 01:52:35	+mobo	nope, just with IOS
2018-09-28 01:53:02	+LambdaComplex	getting the basics set up on junos was pretty ez
2018-09-28 01:53:24	+LambdaComplex	had to go through some extra steps for this setup since static routes aren't redistributed through ospf by default
2018-09-28 01:53:36	+LambdaComplex	but w/e it was like 2 lines to create a policy then 1 line to apply the policy to the ospf protocol

2018-09-28 01:55:37	+LambdaComplex	why's that
2018-09-28 01:55:44	+LambdaComplex	also you never answered my question from before
2018-09-28 01:55:44	+brooks	because weechat has anti-flood enabled by default

2018-09-28 02:00:05	+winny	brooks: what are you eating
2018-09-28 02:00:25	+mobo	nah, textual
2018-09-28 02:00:27	+brooks	I'm pretty much out of food and 2 rural for delivery
2018-09-28 02:00:30	+brooks	oh ok
2018-09-28 02:00:36	+brooks	wait I knew that, my bad
2018-09-28 02:00:38	+winny	mobo: nice, i wrote some code for textual awhile back
2018-09-28 02:00:49	+winny	i found a bug where textual double PONGs
2018-09-28 02:00:55	+winny	certain IRCds shit on that
2018-09-28 02:01:12	+LambdaComplex	https://man.openbsd.org/ospfd.conf.5
2018-09-28 02:01:17	+LambdaComplex	yeah this looks super easy
2018-09-28 02:01:41	+LambdaComplex	brooks: better go set a figure 4 deadfall trap and catch a squirrel
2018-09-28 02:01:59	+brooks	just fuckin try to stop me
2018-09-28 02:02:35	+LambdaComplex	honestly i think if you can find a location then setting a fish trap is probably your best bet
2018-09-28 02:02:35	+mobo	nice
2018-09-28 02:02:58	+brooks	I probably could but I haven't liked local fish in my exp so far
2018-09-28 02:03:02	+brooks	which is not a lot tbf
2018-09-28 02:03:09	+winny	teach a man to fish...
2018-09-28 02:03:14	+LambdaComplex	i pretty much can't stand fish
2018-09-28 02:03:23	+LambdaComplex	but if i'm at the point where it's either catch/eat fish or starve.....
2018-09-28 02:03:24	+winny	then he'll have to get a fishing license, and a license to cook fish, and a license for an open flame
2018-09-28 02:03:25	+brooks	there was ONE fish fry I went to as a kid that was actually fucking incredible
2018-09-28 02:03:39	+brooks	I only need the first of those

2018-09-28 02:03:49	+brooks	idk if fires are illegal here, but they're commonplace
2018-09-28 02:04:02	+brooks	oh licenses for open flame are common tho
2018-09-28 02:04:08	+winny	oh they are? lmao
2018-09-28 02:04:10	+brooks	I think I have my fishing license currently
2018-09-28 02:04:15	+brooks	yeah, you need permission from fire dept

2018-09-28 02:06:22	+brooks	....maybe cook digiorno but that sounds like a lot
2018-09-28 02:06:40	+winny	the krogers pizzas are oddly good
2018-09-28 02:06:53	+winny	i bought them for $3/ea and they are rising
2018-09-28 02:07:11	+brooks	not bad

2018-09-28 03:04:59	+brooks	venezuela is actually quickly recovering
2018-09-28 03:05:01	+brooks	and
2018-09-28 03:05:03	+brooks	worth noting:
2018-09-28 03:05:26	+brooks	the fucking right wing of the country burned tons and tons of food that was going to be sent out for aid
2018-09-28 03:05:54	+dysfigured	actually burned? like, "fuck you we'll set fire to it before we see it get used"?
2018-09-28 03:05:56	+brooks	yes
2018-09-28 03:06:05	+dysfigured	which country
2018-09-28 03:06:09	+brooks	venezuela
2018-09-28 03:06:37	+dysfigured	people from The Right™ in Venezuela set fire to food instead of letting it be used to help people who were hungry?
2018-09-28 03:06:44	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-28 03:06:49	+dysfigured	that's.
2018-09-28 03:06:52	+dysfigured	astounding.
2018-09-28 03:06:57	+brooks	40 tons btw
2018-09-28 03:07:00	+dysfigured	wow.
2018-09-28 03:07:17	+dysfigured	talk about artificial scarcity
2018-09-28 03:07:32	+brooks	>walk into a supermarket
2018-09-28 03:07:34	+brooks	>all this food
2018-09-28 03:07:36	+naught0	why can't you just accept that communism is just a quaint idea that will never work ! ! !!
2018-09-28 03:07:38	+brooks	>how can anyone hate capitalism
2018-09-28 03:07:49	+naught0	R e ee e e 
2018-09-28 03:07:59	+brooks	>then you find out about half the food there either gets thrown out or was thrown out before it made it to the store
2018-09-28 03:08:19	+brooks	>and all this food is here while 2 blocks down you have 10 people who can't eat any of it
2018-09-28 03:08:27	+naught0	half + half is 100% brooks

2018-09-28 03:09:05	+brooks	on a brighter note:
2018-09-28 03:09:09	+brooks	my noodles r good
2018-09-28 03:09:21	+naught0	I had ramen today
2018-09-28 03:09:24	+dysfigured	tbh idk how anybody can look at the state of our infrastructure and distribution for food, and the abundance that we can cultivate food sources in, and not immediately realize that the only thing stopping us from fixing world hunger is artificial scarcity and concern for profit loss
2018-09-28 03:09:38	+naught0	I keep it nice and firm :')
2018-09-28 03:09:43	+brooks	same
2018-09-28 03:09:45	+brooks	@ firm
2018-09-28 03:10:06	+brooks	dysfigured: perverse incentives + not knowing what communism actually is
2018-09-28 03:10:56	+brooks	if you nationalize aids drugs, for example, the incentive to experiment with cures and research is destroyed because the companies who would be investing in this will never see a return on investment
2018-09-28 03:11:08	+dysfigured	disregard communism and theory and shit. try and remember being 6-7 years old and trying to understand how there can be so much food in grocery stores and homeless people people outside begging for change
2018-09-28 03:11:21	+brooks	mix this basic logic with "communism is when the government redistributes stuff", you get "obviously capitalism is the only thing that makes sense"
2018-09-28 03:11:28	+brooks	and if these were both true, they'd be right

2018-09-28 03:18:18	+Cosumu	only the commie code
2018-09-28 03:18:28	+winny	damn commies
2018-09-28 03:18:36	+brooks	it's about code sometimes
2018-09-28 03:18:49	+brooks	currently trying to figure out whether st is worth it
2018-09-28 03:18:53	+brooks	the terminal
2018-09-28 03:19:36	+Cosumu	st is wroth it
2018-09-28 03:19:48	+Cosumu	just steal someons config
2018-09-28 03:19:51	+Cosumu	and edit it
2018-09-28 03:20:02	+brooks	what are its downsides tbh
2018-09-28 03:20:04	+brooks	it seems
2018-09-28 03:20:06	+brooks	2 good 2 be tru
2018-09-28 03:20:19	+brooks	by which I mean, I'm inclined to expect it to have a ton of usability issues
2018-09-28 03:20:26	+Cosumu	its good
2018-09-28 03:20:31	+Cosumu	but i had af ew issues
2018-09-28 03:20:35	+Cosumu	mainly no copy paste and url things
2018-09-28 03:20:37	+Cosumu	and dint' want to perl
2018-09-28 03:20:47	+naught0	which one of you killed kori, skinned him, and are wearing his skin rn
2018-09-28 03:20:59	+naught0	u can tell me u won't get in trouble
2018-09-28 03:21:01	+brooks	and then when I complain suckless will be like "you are abusing your terminal" rather than "oh, you're right, this perfectly normal and commonly expected behavior is absent and we should fix that"
2018-09-28 03:21:04	+winny	naught0: sounds gein af
2018-09-28 03:21:12	+naught0	oo that was clever

2018-09-28 03:21:30	+winny	Cosumu: tbh been using alacritty for awhile
2018-09-28 03:21:32	+winny	it seems nice
2018-09-28 03:21:34	+brooks	hufflepuff best house
2018-09-28 03:21:34	+Cosumu	owow
2018-09-28 03:21:41	+Cosumu	i coudn't gert alacrity to compile it was pain
2018-09-28 03:21:47	+winny	lol
2018-09-28 03:21:48	+naught0	I got ravenclaw Q_Q
2018-09-28 03:21:50	+naught0	ever tim
2018-09-28 03:21:52	+Cosumu	gotta go fast
2018-09-28 03:21:58	+winny	u should install a package for alacritty
2018-09-28 03:22:05	+brooks	kori tried to talk me into using st a while ago but I was like "isn't st trash" and he didn't use it for anything that might challenge it so we never resolved it
2018-09-28 03:22:16	+winny	imo u shouldn't use software that isn't packaged by your package manager
2018-09-28 03:22:17	+naught0	don't you have to recompile st every time
2018-09-28 03:22:19	+naught0	you change something
2018-09-28 03:22:31	+brooks	yeah but you shouldn't be changing things often
2018-09-28 03:22:34	+brooks	it's not really a config
2018-09-28 03:22:40	+brooks	it's more like customizing the program
2018-09-28 03:22:43	+brooks	that being siad:
2018-09-28 03:23:01	+brooks	suckless is stupid and also hahahahha suckless more like suckmore am I right
2018-09-28 03:23:23	+brooks	winny: what if you use gentoo
2018-09-28 03:23:31	+winny	brooks: i use gentoo
2018-09-28 03:23:38	+brooks	do you make your own ebuilds
2018-09-28 03:23:48	+winny	sometimes but not often
2018-09-28 03:24:01	+naught0	I mean, suckless doesn't suck all the time 
2018-09-28 03:24:03	+winny	for things that require compile time configuration, there is a savedconfig functionality
2018-09-28 03:24:04	+brooks	do you consider making ebuilds using sw that isn't packaged
2018-09-28 03:24:14	+winny	brooks: yes always, it's pretty easy and it's really rare
2018-09-28 03:24:16	+naught0	dwm is fine and dandy, so's surf if you're /shrug
2018-09-28 03:24:18	+brooks	no I mean
2018-09-28 03:24:27	+brooks	do you consider it a violation of your opinion from a little bit ago
2018-09-28 03:24:42	+Cosumu	!!!!!!!!
2018-09-28 03:24:45	+Cosumu	brooks: how are you
2018-09-28 03:24:46	+winny	brooks: no because i'm packaging the software
2018-09-28 03:24:47	+Cosumu	im great
2018-09-28 03:24:49	+Cosumu	what abot yourself
2018-09-28 03:24:51	+Cosumu	tyhat is nice
2018-09-28 03:24:51	+winny	so i can easily deploy it across my computers
2018-09-28 03:24:51	+brooks	that's what I thought you meant
2018-09-28 03:24:53	+brooks	nice
2018-09-28 03:24:55	+naught0	Cosumu: are you on coke
2018-09-28 03:24:55	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-28 03:24:59	+brooks	I just wanted to see which way you meant it
2018-09-28 03:25:06	+winny	yeah it just makes life easy
2018-09-28 03:25:08	+naught0	this is a drug free zone
2018-09-28 03:25:12	+naught0	don't make me report u 
2018-09-28 03:25:13	+Cosumu	naught0: no im not on coke
2018-09-28 03:25:16	+Cosumu	im not on any drugs
2018-09-28 03:25:22	+Cosumu	im just energetic bc i haven't gone outside
2018-09-28 03:25:24	+naught0	guilty until proven innocent 
2018-09-28 03:25:26	+Cosumu	i needa go for a walk or a run
2018-09-28 03:25:27	+naught0	cy@ buddy
2018-09-28 03:25:27	+brooks	like if you meant "software shouldn't be outside your package manager" or "you should be relying on maintainers to package software rather than attempting it yourself"
2018-09-28 03:25:28	+naught0	pew pew
2018-09-28 03:25:30	+Cosumu	naught0: this isn't amerca sorry
2018-09-28 03:25:33	+winny	naught0: im high on beer
2018-09-28 03:25:38	+naught0	winny: same tbh dont' tell me mum
2018-09-28 03:26:02	+winny	brooks: tbh idk if gentoo is the solution
2018-09-28 03:26:08	+winny	i think nixos or guixsd is probably the future
2018-09-28 03:26:17	+brooks	naught0: nah the software is ok. I always use slock and dmenu is ok
2018-09-28 03:26:50	+brooks	I like guixsd a lot in theory, but I'm not sure I want to use it
2018-09-28 03:26:51	+winny	i use i3lock and rofi instead of those two
2018-09-28 03:26:55	+naught0	I moved to rofi since I'm a sucker for pywal
2018-09-28 03:27:02	+winny	pywal?
2018-09-28 03:27:09	+naught0	aka `wal`
2018-09-28 03:27:12	+winny	i just like rofi's UI
2018-09-28 03:27:17	+winny	it's centered on the screen
2018-09-28 03:27:23	+brooks	Cosumu: I'm pretty good, just messin' around with my software
2018-09-28 03:27:26	+naught0	it auto generates colorschemes for xresources and rofi and junk
2018-09-28 03:27:29	+naught0	based on wallpapers
2018-09-28 03:27:34	+winny	and has built in history without any messing about
2018-09-28 03:27:35	+brooks	that's actually the only reason I'm not using rofi
2018-09-28 03:27:42	+Cosumu	!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2018-09-28 03:27:44	+Cosumu	nice brokke
2018-09-28 03:27:52	+brooks	I want it to sometimes be positioned like dmenu is
2018-09-28 03:27:54	+winny	lol wal sounds silly
2018-09-28 03:28:05	+winny	tbh i never do, cuz i only use it to launch programs
2018-09-28 03:28:18	+brooks	I use it with pass
2018-09-28 03:28:30	+brooks	and as a kind of "url opener"
2018-09-28 03:28:39	+brooks	if I click links, dmenu asks me what I wanna do with them
2018-09-28 03:28:45	+winny	oh nice
2018-09-28 03:28:54	+naught0	brooks: you can make it exactly like dmenu
2018-09-28 03:28:54	+winny	i need to write a url handler
2018-09-28 03:28:55	+yossarian	dmenu is pretty much a perfect tool
2018-09-28 03:29:07	+naught0	which, at that point, why not dmenu
2018-09-28 03:29:08	+brooks	I just want it to have fuzzy matching out of the box
2018-09-28 03:29:21	+brooks	well I'd want it to be rofi sometimes and dmenu other times, so that I don't need dmenu
2018-09-28 03:29:29	+naught0	rofi is fuzzy*
2018-09-28 03:29:30	+brooks	because I do like rofi
2018-09-28 03:29:35	+naught0	* statements not evaluated by anyone that knows anything
2018-09-28 03:29:43	+brooks	I'm pretty sure it is
2018-09-28 03:29:50	+yossarian	i have both installed, but rofi does too much for me
2018-09-28 03:29:55	+naught0	the matching seemed on-par if not better than dmenu
2018-09-28 03:29:57	+winny	i was pleased to see a good amount of machines running linux today at cs club
2018-09-28 03:30:05	+naught0	I would hope at CS club
2018-09-28 03:30:13	+yossarian	the fuzzy matching is nice, but i don't understand why it has like 4 different built-in selection systems
2018-09-28 03:30:14	+winny	there are so many windows tards
2018-09-28 03:30:16	+naught0	a lot of the C#/C++ lads are definitely running VS Studio tho
2018-09-28 03:30:26	+naught0	> VS studio
2018-09-28 03:30:33	+naught0	 /part
2018-09-28 03:36:32	+dysfigured	brooks: the suckless answer to "this perfectly normal and commonly expected behavior is absent and we should fix that" is actually "learn C yourself and write a patch for it or fuck off"
2018-09-28 03:36:45	+naught0	is it all in straight C
2018-09-28 03:36:47	+brooks	true
2018-09-28 03:36:48	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-28 03:37:02	+naught0	just write it in nim n00bs :~)
2018-09-28 03:37:10	+brooks	otoh
2018-09-28 03:37:13	+dysfigured	the real solution to dmenu's missing features is to use fzf
2018-09-28 03:37:14	+brooks	I'm trying to get to that point
2018-09-28 03:37:31	+brooks	it's in go
2018-09-28 03:37:37	+naught0	> written in go
2018-09-28 03:37:37	+dysfigured	idc if you need  a window manager, manage windows with fzf
2018-09-28 03:37:40	+naught0	enjoy your generics
2018-09-28 03:37:42	+naught0	oh wait
2018-09-28 03:37:50	+brooks	if I'm gonna use go I have to bootstrap it with gcc first
2018-09-28 03:38:59	+brooks	which I haven't done yet
2018-09-28 03:39:01	+dysfigured	i just want to write high level code and have computers figure out the rest
2018-09-28 03:39:28	+naught0	That's why I write exclusively in python3 lul
2018-09-28 03:39:44	+dysfigured	python is so imperative tho
2018-09-28 03:39:52	+Cosumu	!
2018-09-28 03:39:56	+brooks	you have to trust other people for this
2018-09-28 03:39:58	+brooks	I don't and won't
2018-09-28 03:40:00	+naught0	I'm not at all intelligent when it comes to coding tbh
2018-09-28 03:40:09	+dysfigured	python it still feels like you're micro managing everything
2018-09-28 03:40:12	+naught0	so idk what "statically typed" or "imperative" or "objective" is
2018-09-28 03:40:16	+brooks	hey dysfigured have you checked out nim
2018-09-28 03:40:17	+naught0	dysfigured: it sure doesn't tho
2018-09-28 03:40:32	+naught0	brooks: have you looked at the more 'advanced' examples? they look absolutely awful
2018-09-28 03:40:51	+brooks	I haven't
2018-09-28 03:41:01	+brooks	I just know it's for metaprogramming and inspired by python
2018-09-28 03:41:09	+brooks	and is supposed to have good ffi because it compiles to C
2018-09-28 03:41:10	+dysfigured	statically typed means a variable that is given a certain type will not change it's type
2018-09-28 03:41:30	+brooks	I thought that was strong typing
2018-09-28 03:41:47	+naught0	also it has procs and things that are just like procs that are weird
2018-09-28 03:41:51	+naught0	and its classes are also weird imo
2018-09-28 03:42:03	+brooks	with nim 0.19
2018-09-28 03:42:05	+brooks	which came out today
2018-09-28 03:42:08	+brooks	funcs are procs
2018-09-28 03:42:22	+naught0	ok great because it was a weird distinction that really turned me off to it
2018-09-28 03:42:28	+naught0	then again I am an ape so
2018-09-28 03:42:40	+brooks	we r all apes on this blessed day
2018-09-28 03:42:43	+brooks	where's kori when you need him
2018-09-28 03:42:44	+naught0	lol
2018-09-28 03:42:47	+dysfigured	brooks: fuck, maybe, idk i'm googling again
2018-09-28 03:43:06	+naught0	Ok great I thought I was the only one that read the first sentence on the wiki page and was like "wtf does any of that actually mean"
2018-09-28 03:43:47	+naught0	X " is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines"
2018-09-28 03:43:55	+dysfigured	i looked at nim a while ago, it seemed like another boring imperative language that also transpiles to other languages
2018-09-28 03:43:55	+naught0	like fuck off with that shit m8e
2018-09-28 03:44:15	+brooks	that's weird
2018-09-28 03:44:18	+brooks	back when it was called nimrod
2018-09-28 03:44:24	+brooks	the whole purpose was metaprogramming
2018-09-28 03:44:53	+naught0	no sorry that was for C#, I was just illustrating the giant first sentence of wiki articles for some language
2018-09-28 03:45:02	+naught0	+s
2018-09-28 03:45:48	+brooks	oh no I was replying to dysfigured 
2018-09-28 03:45:49	+brooks	but
2018-09-28 03:45:54	+brooks	I thought he pasted that as well
2018-09-28 03:46:05	+naught0	boy sure is confusing in here
2018-09-28 03:46:17	+naught0	a-am I brooks 
2018-09-28 03:46:21	+Arathnim	At least their metaprogramming is decided by compile time.
2018-09-28 03:46:30	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-28 03:46:38	+brooks	I thought this seemed like your kinda thing 
2018-09-28 03:46:41	+brooks	god you guys
2018-09-28 03:46:46	+brooks	and gals and variations thereupon
2018-09-28 03:47:07	+naught0	listen, being genderless is certainly not a variation upon gals and guys
2018-09-28 03:47:10	+brooks	I keep leaving software for long stretches at a time and when I get back I have to rediscover my interests
2018-09-28 03:47:13	+naught0	... I think
2018-09-28 03:47:18	+Cosumu	despacito
2018-09-28 03:47:20	+dysfigured	i still don't understand metaprogramming, beyond a basic grasp of macros
2018-09-28 03:47:21	+brooks	I would disagree, but asexuals would fight me
2018-09-28 03:48:10	+naught0	have you ever visited /r/toiletpaperUSA
2018-09-28 03:48:10	+brooks	I mean agendered people wtf was that
2018-09-28 03:48:16	+naught0	you tried and I accept you for it
2018-09-28 03:48:18	+brooks	no but that sounds hilarious
2018-09-28 03:48:22	+naught0	it's so fucking good
2018-09-28 03:48:28	+naught0	it's basically what occurs in my mind 24/7
2018-09-28 03:48:29	+naught0	on repeat
2018-09-28 03:48:30	+Arathnim	You tell the compiler to change some code based on a trigger into some other code.
2018-09-28 03:48:44	+naught0	compile nim code to hello world in JS
2018-09-28 03:48:47	+naught0	pls pls
2018-09-28 03:49:27	+naught0	it's as beautiful as it is hideous
2018-09-28 03:49:59	+naught0	brooks: https://i.redd.it/dtgw40atmvo11.png
2018-09-28 03:50:04	+brooks	metaprogramming is when you write code that transforms into other code
2018-09-28 03:50:08	+Arathnim	If your language is awful, this happens on a text-based level, if it's good, you have access to type information and everything is AST transformations.
2018-09-28 03:50:08	 *	Cosumu pets brooks
2018-09-28 03:50:28	+brooks	that's a good way to put it
2018-09-28 03:50:34	+brooks	naught0: KEK
2018-09-28 03:50:36	+brooks	yes
2018-09-28 03:50:41	+naught0	bro it's so good
2018-09-28 03:50:42	+brooks	Iv'e seen these memes but I haven't seen this sub
2018-09-28 03:50:44	+naught0	do yourself a favor and visit
2018-09-28 03:50:49	+naught0	it is the point of origin
2018-09-28 03:50:53	+naught0	the singularity 
2018-09-28 03:51:10	+naught0	the genesis, the big bang
2018-09-28 03:51:57	+brooks	https://i.redd.it/2zxz56xdqvo11.jpg naught0 I am going to fucking die
2018-09-28 03:52:11	+naught0	lul
2018-09-28 03:52:15	+naught0	m e t a
2018-09-28 03:52:24	+dysfigured	brooks: from what i can tell, there is static or dynamic typing, and then there are grey areas where static languages allow casting or coercion in certain scenarios and dynamic languages that support enforcing certain types, and so strong/weak is a sort of expression of that spectrum
2018-09-28 03:52:51	+naught0	I want to write an entire OS in perl
2018-09-28 03:52:52	+naught0	who's with me
2018-09-28 03:53:52	+naught0	tough crowd
2018-09-28 03:54:04	+dysfigured	i still don't understand what makes C/C++ and Rust system-level as opposed to python or ruby
2018-09-28 03:54:25	+Cosumu	dysfigured: h r u 
2018-09-28 03:54:39	+dysfigured	g w b u
2018-09-28 03:55:01	+yossarian	dysfigured: the 1 second answer is that none of them have a "runtime" in the same way that python or ruby does
2018-09-28 03:55:15	+naught0	is rust compiled?
2018-09-28 03:55:17	+yossarian	yes
2018-09-28 03:55:17	+dysfigured	yes
2018-09-28 03:55:19	+naught0	if so isn't it compiled vs interpreted
2018-09-28 03:55:31	+yossarian	not necessarily, compiled languages can have runtimes
2018-09-28 03:55:36	+yossarian	see: C#
2018-09-28 03:55:39	+dysfigured	also java
2018-09-28 03:55:53	+yossarian	java too, but i didn't want to give that because "hurr it's not really compiled"
2018-09-28 03:55:53	+dysfigured	.net and jvm respectively
2018-09-28 03:56:16	+dysfigured	java code->jvm bytecode isn't compiling?
2018-09-28 03:56:36	+naught0	what's that one lang that runs on jvm
2018-09-28 03:56:36	+yossarian	i think it is, but it's more ambiguous than C->machine code
2018-09-28 03:56:38	+naught0	kotlin?
2018-09-28 03:56:44	+dysfigured	there's a bunch that run on the jvm
2018-09-28 03:56:50	+naught0	the one
2018-09-28 03:56:59	+dysfigured	clojure, scala, groovy
2018-09-28 03:57:14	+dysfigured	idk kotlin did
2018-09-28 03:57:22	+yossarian	on a scale of 0 (purely interpreted) to 100 (purely compiled), java is like an 80% and C# is like a 90%
2018-09-28 03:57:36	+dysfigured	javascript is jit compiled, lua can be as well
2018-09-28 03:57:48	+dysfigured	python has cpython
2018-09-28 03:57:50	+yossarian	yeah, JITs sit somewhere around 50
2018-09-28 03:58:00	+brooks	naught0: let's fucking do it
2018-09-28 03:58:04	+yossarian	cpython isn't JIT'd
2018-09-28 03:58:17	+dysfigured	right, i just mean to blur the line of what i means to be a compiled language
2018-09-28 03:58:21	+dysfigured	*it means
2018-09-28 03:58:22	+yossarian	oic, yeah
2018-09-28 03:58:26	+naught0	:o
2018-09-28 03:58:31	+naught0	python has a JIT innit
2018-09-28 03:58:34	+yossarian	nope
2018-09-28 03:58:35	+brooks	kotlin runs on jvm yeah
2018-09-28 03:58:42	+brooks	it's for android
2018-09-28 03:58:51	+yossarian	python does not have a JIT in the reference impl
2018-09-28 03:58:53	+naught0	no I mean it _has_ a JIT interpreter 
2018-09-28 03:58:58	+brooks	python has a vm
2018-09-28 03:59:12	+yossarian	naught0: what is a JIT interpreter?
2018-09-28 03:59:17	+brooks	it compiles to a bytecode when it runs but I don't htink that's jit
2018-09-28 03:59:21	+yossarian	a JIT is a kind of compiler, invoked by the interpreter
2018-09-28 03:59:26	+naught0	oh sorry compiler 
2018-09-28 03:59:32	+brooks	I heard from kori btw
2018-09-28 03:59:44	+yossarian	yeah, python doesn't have any form of JIT currently
2018-09-28 03:59:47	+yossarian	maybe pypy does?
2018-09-28 03:59:48	+yossarian	not sure
2018-09-28 03:59:50	+brooks	he'll be home in the next couple of days
2018-09-28 04:00:08	+naught0	https://pypy.org/
2018-09-28 04:00:08	+yossarian	i should say that by "python" i mean "cpython," since 95% of people are running cpython
2018-09-28 04:00:13	+naught0	peed: thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler, Python programs often run faster on PyPy.
2018-09-28 04:00:17	+brooks	hey I have a q about rust
2018-09-28 04:00:19	+naught0	Speed*
2018-09-28 04:00:21	+yossarian	yeah, so pypy does, that's nice
2018-09-28 04:00:23	+dysfigured	i think javascript, python, ruby, and perl all use some kind of vm technqiues that i don't really understand. well, i don't really understand a whole about compilation tbh
2018-09-28 04:00:44	+yossarian	ruby is adding a JIT pretty soon
2018-09-28 04:00:49	+brooks	rust has a runtime, but is it the same kinda runtime as like ruby or python
2018-09-28 04:01:00	+yossarian	all of the big JS interpreters contain a JIT
2018-09-28 04:01:03	+brooks	ruby 2.6 has the jit enabled, but it's behind a flag
2018-09-28 04:01:04	+yossarian	idk about perl, probably not
2018-09-28 04:01:09	+yossarian	yeah
2018-09-28 04:01:21	+brooks	ruby 3.0 is supposed to be 3x as fast as 2.0
2018-09-28 04:01:27	+brooks	that's the Goal anyway
2018-09-28 04:01:29	+naught0	I don't know much about codin and just remembered something bout JIT yossarian /shrug
2018-09-28 04:01:33	+yossarian	both ruby and python have extremely complicated memory models and large exposed API surfaces
2018-09-28 04:01:39	+yossarian	which make them very hard to design JITs for
2018-09-28 04:01:44	+brooks	I'm pretty excited about this but tbh I think it's too late for ruby to beat python
2018-09-28 04:01:48	+yossarian	naught0: all good
2018-09-28 04:01:55	+yossarian	and yeah, i agree
2018-09-28 04:01:55	+dysfigured	tl;dr of this discussion is that compiled vs interpreted is a very blurry line, many languages that are considered 'interpreted' aren't even really
2018-09-28 04:01:56	+naught0	pretty sure pypy is incompatible with a lot of the python C stuff or whatever
2018-09-28 04:02:06	+yossarian	no matter how much i like ruby, it's never going to beat python
2018-09-28 04:02:14	+naught0	python for life tbh
2018-09-28 04:02:17	+brooks	ruby is by far the better language
2018-09-28 04:02:20	+brooks	like, it's not even a contest
2018-09-28 04:02:23	+yossarian	naught0: mhm, it has some subtle C extension incompatibilities
2018-09-28 04:02:24	+naught0	r u sure bout that
2018-09-28 04:02:25	+brooks	but python has the better tools and resources
2018-09-28 04:02:26	+brooks	yes
2018-09-28 04:02:28	+brooks	100%
2018-09-28 04:02:43	+brooks	dysfigured: that's not really true
2018-09-28 04:02:48	+naught0	beep boop ur argument is invalid
2018-09-28 04:02:49	+yossarian	yeah, i'd say ruby solidly wins in both design and writing pleasure
2018-09-28 04:02:53	+dysfigured	python as a language as no 'expressivity' which proponents say is a feature
2018-09-28 04:02:53	+naught0	hehehe
2018-09-28 04:03:00	+brooks	like it's true in some sense but even at the level of the current conversation it's not true enough to be the key factor in that discussion
2018-09-28 04:03:05	+naught0	dysfigured: what is 'expressivity'
2018-09-28 04:03:07	+isk	any of you know if/where libinput outputs logs
2018-09-28 04:03:15	+brooks	golang nerds also claim that's a feature
2018-09-28 04:03:24	+isk	naught0: basically functionality per character typed
2018-09-28 04:03:25	+brooks	syslog?
2018-09-28 04:03:27	+yossarian	yeah, it's a form of language brutalism
2018-09-28 04:03:35	+yossarian	golang and python are excellent examples of it
2018-09-28 04:03:36	+dysfigured	brooks: i.. oh
2018-09-28 04:03:37	+naught0	oh neat
2018-09-28 04:03:55	+isk	highly expressive means you get a lot of features in relatively little code
2018-09-28 04:03:59	+yossarian	and it's not necessarily a bad strategy, in terms of keeping your herd of code monkeys from engineering themselves into a corner
2018-09-28 04:04:03	+isk	often at the cost of performance hits from generalization
2018-09-28 04:04:19	+dysfigured	well, idk, i mean, i feel like expressivity is like "ability to write your code in many ways depending on style"
2018-09-28 04:04:33	+yossarian	that's called TIMTOWDI in the perl/ruby world
2018-09-28 04:04:36	+dysfigured	yes
2018-09-28 04:04:42	+brooks	dysfigured: it's definitely a reasonable thing to make clear in a conversation like this, but it's not something I think means this conversation isn't worth having
2018-09-28 04:04:55	+yossarian	TIMTOWTDI*
2018-09-28 04:04:59	+yossarian	always get that wrong
2018-09-28 04:05:09	+dysfigured	There Is More Than One Way To Do It
2018-09-28 04:05:39	+yossarian	the irony is that python set out to be the opposite of tim-toady, but ended up being full of it
2018-09-28 04:05:42	+brooks	perl has the best writeup on "here's what using a language should be like" I've ever seen
2018-09-28 04:05:45	+yossarian	see: string formatting, os vs sys, etc
2018-09-28 04:06:13	+sj1k	o/ all
2018-09-28 04:06:14	+yossarian	perl6 might be the best language ever made, if anybody could figure out how to use it correctly
2018-09-28 04:06:34	+yossarian	it's so tim-toady that there's no way to tell if you're writing idiomatic code
2018-09-28 04:06:43	+yossarian	at least ruby kinda looks wrong when you're way off base
2018-09-28 04:07:06	+dysfigured	but that's the point of perl, idiomatic code should just be your personal style
2018-09-28 04:07:08	+brooks	isk: I haven't found the answer to your q but I did find this docs site https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/troubleshooting.html
2018-09-28 04:07:35	+yossarian	dysfigured: yeah, and i don't think that holds up when taken to the logical extreme
2018-09-28 04:07:42	+dysfigured	if you want to be a perl shop and write very C-like perl, you can do that, or you can try and write functional perl
2018-09-28 04:07:48	+brooks	isk: is libinput something I can just replace synaptics with or something
2018-09-28 04:07:48	+yossarian	it's the same problem that functional languages have, minus all of the nice guarantees
2018-09-28 04:07:59	+naught0	brooks: https://i.imgur.com/zEdwdDi.jpg
2018-09-28 04:08:10	+brooks	kek
2018-09-28 04:08:20	+yossarian	where everybody writes these insane and unmaintainable abstractions for their particular use cases
2018-09-28 04:08:21	+naught0	:')
2018-09-28 04:08:28	+brooks	sounds like lisp
2018-09-28 04:08:32	+brooks	in a good way
2018-09-28 04:08:32	+yossarian	small face meme is an excellent meme
2018-09-28 04:08:40	+yossarian	yeah
2018-09-28 04:08:42	+dysfigured	it's interesting to note that perl was very proud of being expressive and letting one write their code how they wanted to, and then python was like fuck you do it my way and people ate it up
2018-09-28 04:08:43	+naught0	any meme for turningpoint is ok in my book
2018-09-28 04:08:58	+yossarian	it's a lot of fun to write those abstractions, but they're awful in terms of engineering practice
2018-09-28 04:09:01	+brooks	dysfigured: the trick is python is for non-programmers in the same way php was
2018-09-28 04:09:12	+brooks	that's why
2018-09-28 04:09:25	+yossarian	and also herding your engineers
2018-09-28 04:09:30	+brooks	"there should be one and preferably only one correct way to do it" or whatever is EXCELLENT for neophytes
2018-09-28 04:09:33	+brooks	yep that too
2018-09-28 04:09:39	+brooks	but it's terrible for 'real programmers'
2018-09-28 04:09:47	+brooks	especially if you aren't just trying to get a paycheck
2018-09-28 04:10:00	+yossarian	4 years of CS education doesn't a good programmer make, it's makes you nominally qualified to type magic words into a computer and collect a paycheck for it
2018-09-28 04:10:23	+brooks	if python had been my first language, I would probably have loved it
2018-09-28 04:10:27	+yossarian	that doesn't mean "real" programmers don't use python, they obviously do
2018-09-28 04:10:39	+brooks	but it was my second or third depending on how you count and I had never felt so suffocated by computers in my life
2018-09-28 04:11:09	+yossarian	but it's like go, where the language itself is defensive and opinionated in a way that makes it hard(er) to do poor engineering
2018-09-28 04:11:32	+brooks	this was before I grew up into a world where android is killing everything that let me protect myself, ME was put into every intel processor since 2008, desktop linux started being chocked to death, etc., etc., etc. but it still counts
2018-09-28 04:11:49	+yossarian	my first languages were csh and perl4
2018-09-28 04:11:54	+yossarian	may god have pity on my soul
2018-09-28 04:12:09	+brooks	perl5 was out when I graduated from my first langs
2018-09-28 04:12:25	+yossarian	yeah, perl5 was out at the time
2018-09-28 04:12:34	+yossarian	but i only had my dad's sun box, which had perl4 and no internet
2018-09-28 04:12:36	+brooks	I was still using windows, though, and perl was terrible on it
2018-09-28 04:12:42	+brooks	...nice
2018-09-28 04:12:59	+brooks	I never had any of those cool experiences like that
2018-09-28 04:13:10	+brooks	I'd probably be a better programmer
2018-09-28 04:13:15	+yossarian	it's weird, i have no idea where he learned to use a sun box
2018-09-28 04:13:18	+yossarian	he's not technical
2018-09-28 04:13:32	+brooks	tfw no ibm 5100
2018-09-28 04:13:37	+brooks	I'd be a gOD
2018-09-28 04:13:38	+brooks	GOD*
2018-09-28 04:13:40	+yossarian	but he uses ssh and has a 20 year old public UNIX account that he checks mail on
2018-09-28 04:13:40	+sj1k	Only upside of the languages that lock you into specific ways is that if you do jive with it you get some nice bonuses
2018-09-28 04:14:04	+brooks	it reminds me of basic but like the opposite of basic
2018-09-28 04:14:26	+Arathnim	I started out with cooperative proramming for multi-player text games. MUSHcode.
2018-09-28 04:14:26	+brooks	instead of learning a bunch of terrible practices, you learn good ones, but your mind gets stuck in them

2018-09-28 04:15:07	+brooks	that's pretty cool
2018-09-28 04:15:33	+brooks	I think my first experiment was actually tcl
2018-09-28 04:16:25	+yossarian	tcl is an interesting language
2018-09-28 04:16:32	+brooks	I don't remember it at all
2018-09-28 04:16:39	+yossarian	i wish i had more opportunities to write it
2018-09-28 04:16:46	+brooks	but it was pretty much an ideal early exposure
2018-09-28 04:16:48	+Arathnim	Domain-specific languages are always the most interesting.
2018-09-28 04:16:59	+brooks	one of those "I have something that works this way and I wish it worked a little differently"
2018-09-28 04:17:05	+brooks	+ feedback loop of having ideas and implementing them
2018-09-28 04:17:11	+yossarian	awk is another underappreciated language
2018-09-28 04:17:22	+brooks	I like awk a lot, but I don't use it enough to remember it in depth
2018-09-28 04:17:44	+brooks	I've read the awk programming language cover to cover twice, and used it as a reference besides, but I always forget the language
2018-09-28 04:17:46	+yossarian	it's a full language, but most people only interact with it in one-liners
2018-09-28 04:17:48	+Arathnim	It's interesting, but I'd prefer if it didn't have cause to exist.
2018-09-28 04:18:08	+yossarian	i like the way it approaches control flow
2018-09-28 04:18:18	+brooks	awk is crippled on linux by that limitation of shebang lines
2018-09-28 04:18:18	+yossarian	but it has lots of 80s mistakes in it
2018-09-28 04:18:22	+brooks	where you can't pass arguments
2018-09-28 04:18:23	+yossarian	yeah
2018-09-28 04:18:33	+brooks	I wonder if they'll ever fix them
2018-09-28 04:18:37	+yossarian	there used to be an awk-to-C compiler
2018-09-28 04:18:44	+brooks	oh that's cool af
2018-09-28 04:18:46	+yossarian	which i would use if it still existed today
2018-09-28 04:19:13	+brooks	definitely
2018-09-28 04:19:29	+brooks	I probably only wrote fully fledged awk scripts a handful of times, but I really enjoyed it
2018-09-28 04:19:51	+brooks	then I found out there was no real way to make standalone awk scripts and it killed my vibe
2018-09-28 04:20:06	+yossarian	mhm
2018-09-28 04:20:19	+brooks	I've had this experience a lot, of discovering things that ought to work a particular way don't, and it's really discouraging

2018-09-28 04:31:13	+Cosumu	o
2018-09-28 04:31:24	+Cosumu	what does dicks do isk ?
2018-09-28 04:31:30	+isk	nothing
2018-09-28 04:31:36	+isk	I was testing if I had write permission
2018-09-28 04:31:44	+isk	dicks is my go to trash variable
2018-09-28 04:32:07	+isk	just that the "touch" command is humorous given this scenario
2018-09-28 04:33:06	+brooks	relatedly I should learn to use tee
2018-09-28 04:37:42	+dysfigured	tee | sh
2018-09-28 04:37:56	+Cosumu	!
2018-09-28 04:38:08	+Cosumu	i feel like that wasn't a good command to run dysfigured 
2018-09-28 04:38:10	+Cosumu	waht will happen
2018-09-28 04:39:01	+dysfigured	you're right it's not
2018-09-28 04:39:29	+Cosumu	phew
2018-09-28 04:39:45	+Cosumu	i like to do a

2018-09-28 04:40:20	+Cosumu	run this brooks 
2018-09-28 04:40:20	+brooks	I never understood that until just now
2018-09-28 04:40:32	+dysfigured	the forkbomb?
2018-09-28 04:40:38	+brooks	yep
2018-09-28 04:40:39	+Cosumu	i have no idea how it works
2018-09-28 04:40:46	+dysfigured	: is a command name
2018-09-28 04:40:56	+brooks	it declares a function and runs it and pipes the output into itself
2018-09-28 04:40:58	+brooks	and detaches from it
2018-09-28 04:41:00	+brooks	then after ;
2018-09-28 04:41:02	+brooks	it calls it
2018-09-28 04:41:04	+brooks	right?
2018-09-28 04:41:06	+dysfigured	also works if you x(){ x|x& }; x
2018-09-28 04:41:22	+brooks	it's self-referential
2018-09-28 04:41:29	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-28 04:41:33	+Cosumu	memorise it
2018-09-28 04:41:42	+Cosumu	and walk into shops and type in into the mac terminals
2018-09-28 04:41:42	+brooks	or x(){ x | x & }; x
2018-09-28 04:41:45	+Cosumu	for the macs on display
2018-09-28 04:41:58	+brooks	now that I understand it, I don't have to memorize it!
2018-09-28 04:42:08	+brooks	weird
2018-09-28 04:42:14	+brooks	idk why I never understood
2018-09-28 04:42:19	+Cosumu	i can't do it bck i dont really get it
2018-09-28 04:42:28	+brooks	well
2018-09-28 04:42:37	+Cosumu	in princple yes
2018-09-28 04:42:41	+Cosumu	but syntaxically not really
2018-09-28 04:42:43	+brooks	you declare a function like foo(){ echo "you called foo" }
2018-09-28 04:42:54	+Cosumu	oh the firtst bit is the declaration
2018-09-28 04:42:55	+brooks	and you can call the function from inside itself to get an infinite loop
2018-09-28 04:42:57	+Cosumu	makes sense
2018-09-28 04:43:05	+brooks	foo(){ echo "you called foo"; foo }
2018-09-28 04:43:08	+brooks	but it still has to be called
2018-09-28 04:43:11	+Cosumu	 i wonder why
2018-09-28 04:43:12	+dysfigured	foo() { foo | foo } foo
2018-09-28 04:43:13	+brooks	foo(){ echo "you called foo"; foo }; foo
2018-09-28 04:43:20	+Cosumu	it isn't soemthing that is considered illeagl by the kernel
2018-09-28 04:43:30	+Cosumu	shoudn't oopkiller get to it
2018-09-28 04:43:42	+dysfigured	linux makes little to no attempts to save you from yourself
2018-09-28 04:43:43	+Cosumu	oom killer i mean
2018-09-28 04:43:47	+brooks	so you want the infinite loop to also fork and make processes
2018-09-28 04:43:52	+brooks	so you use & to disconnect it
2018-09-28 04:44:01	+brooks	foo(){ echo "you called foo"; foo & }; foo
2018-09-28 04:44:02	+Cosumu	well to me it seems like the simpliest bit of malware
2018-09-28 04:44:09	+dysfigured	i think it will still fork and loop without &
2018-09-28 04:44:16	+brooks	with the |
2018-09-28 04:44:19	+brooks	it might
2018-09-28 04:44:21	+dysfigured	& just gives you the shell back to make you think everything's okay for right now
2018-09-28 04:44:21	+Cosumu	like you could add a single line of code to something and ruin peoples systems
2018-09-28 04:44:21	+brooks	not sure
2018-09-28 04:44:36	+brooks	I don't think it should make new processes without &
2018-09-28 04:44:43	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-28 04:44:52	+Cosumu	it would be an easy thing to sneak into some code
2018-09-28 04:45:08	+dysfigured	bad code is incredibly easy to sneak into any codebase
2018-09-28 04:45:12	+dysfigured	people do it every day
2018-09-28 04:45:14	+Cosumu	yea
2018-09-28 04:45:20	+Cosumu	im just surpirsed that oom killer cant deal with it
2018-09-28 04:45:33	+Cosumu	my main issue is you can run it as user and fuck the system
2018-09-28 04:45:41	+brooks	it's not a single process using the mem
2018-09-28 04:45:52	+Cosumu	yea
2018-09-28 04:45:58	+brooks	so that's probably why
2018-09-28 04:46:02	+brooks	it fills out the process tree too
2018-09-28 04:46:03	+Cosumu	i suppose you need to have memory limits for user accounts
2018-09-28 04:46:11	+brooks	I accidentally fork bombed myself a few months ago
2018-09-28 04:46:13	+Cosumu	anyways shwoer bai
2018-09-28 04:46:18	+brooks	have fun
2018-09-28 04:46:34	+Cosumu	should really have if the memory is exceeded it will just termiante the tasks or the user session so the machine doesn't crash
2018-09-28 04:48:17	+dysfigured	any process can run up 100% cpus on all cores
2018-09-28 04:49:26	+dysfigured	brooks: i mostly use tee as an actual command for > and >>, in cases when you need sudo, but it's also good for logging
2018-09-28 04:51:35	+dysfigured	some_cmd | sudo tee file    works you can't like   some_cmd sudo > file   if file is owned by root and you don't want/need to run some_cmd as root as well
2018-09-28 04:52:05	+dysfigured	tee -a  for append like >>
2018-09-28 04:52:06	+brooks	I knew I could do that, but not how
2018-09-28 04:52:11	+brooks	I've also seen it used like uh
2018-09-28 04:53:37	+dysfigured	but because it prints stdout as well as to a file, it "splits" input stream into two output streams, so imagine if tee writes to a fifo as well as piping to another command
2018-09-28 04:54:31	+brooks	this: :w !sudo tee %
2018-09-28 04:55:01	+brooks	this was my first exposure to it, so I always thought it must be really complicated and reading the manual didn't help because I was already spooked
2018-09-28 04:55:57	+dysfigured	:w !cmd    is vimspeak for send the contents of the buffer to a command, and % is vim trick for the path to the current file
2018-09-28 04:56:13	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-28 04:56:18	+brooks	I'm reading a SO answer
2018-09-28 04:56:19	+brooks	now
2018-09-28 04:56:29	+brooks	saying that % is used by vim more generally to mean the current file
2018-09-28 04:56:38	+brooks	e.g. :%s/pattern/replacement/
2018-09-28 04:56:45	+dysfigured	:echo expand('%')
2018-09-28 04:56:48	+brooks	I didn't realize % was being replaced by vim
2018-09-28 04:56:55	+brooks	I thought it was an argument to t
2018-09-28 04:56:56	+brooks	tee*
2018-09-28 04:57:26	+dysfigured	you can also i have a map for  :e %   to "refresh" the current file from disk
2018-09-28 04:57:34	+dysfigured	s/you can also//
2018-09-28 04:57:38	+dysfigured	words are hard
2018-09-28 04:57:39	+brooks	nice
2018-09-28 04:58:29	+dysfigured	if you :ls you'll see % listed next to the current file, and # is the alternate buffer, usually the last visited
2018-09-28 05:00:07	+brooks	I got %a
2018-09-28 05:01:52	+dysfigured	try with 3 files and split

2018-09-28 05:18:14	+yossarian	err, xargs with a command split of 1
2018-09-28 05:18:20	+dysfigured	basically easier syntax than    for x in 1 2 3: do cmd "$x"; done

2018-09-28 05:19:22	+dysfigured	right, but xargs takes lines as stdin and runs a command for each line

2018-09-28 05:22:05	+dysfigured	which is more similar to args i guess
2018-09-28 05:22:11	+dysfigured	*xargs
2018-09-28 05:22:20	+brooks	but if you want to pipe, you need done
2018-09-28 05:22:38	+dysfigured	yeah the for x in do done dance sucks i just wanted something simpler
2018-09-28 05:22:57	+yossarian	xargs can be incredibly frustrating at times, simple functions like these are nice
2018-09-28 05:23:30	+dysfigured	i just don't use xargs, never found a good use for it that i can't do with a simple loop
2018-09-28 05:24:20	+yossarian	it's nice for `big-list | grep | xargs` pipelines
2018-09-28 05:24:49	+yossarian	i.e., the poor man's map-reduce-apply
2018-09-28 05:25:11	+dysfigured	huh. never thought of that
2018-09-28 05:25:20	+dysfigured	or like that, i mean
2018-09-28 05:25:33	+yossarian	for example, here's how i get all of my twitter logins:
2018-09-28 05:25:42	+yossarian	`kbsecret list | grep twitter | xargs kbsecret login`
2018-09-28 05:26:06	+dysfigured	wut
2018-09-28 05:26:18	+dysfigured	what is kbsecret
2018-09-28 05:26:30	+yossarian	https://kbsecret.github.io/#/intro/
2018-09-28 05:26:45	+yossarian	(i wrote it)
2018-09-28 05:26:58	+yossarian	the interface is relatively similar to `pass`
2018-09-28 05:27:10	+dysfigured	why would i want this instead of pass
2018-09-28 05:27:11	+yossarian	in fact, that invocation probably works with pass substituted
2018-09-28 05:27:18	+dysfigured	oh i should read it huh
2018-09-28 05:27:24	+yossarian	no key management, first-class team support
2018-09-28 05:27:35	+yossarian	transparent synchronization to all machines with keybase
2018-09-28 05:27:45	+yossarian	strongly typed records
2018-09-28 05:28:05	+yossarian	it's just a different approach, much of `pass`'s design has strong merits
2018-09-28 05:28:21	+dysfigured	those are cool features, but not sure i would use them
2018-09-28 05:28:41	+yossarian	yeah, it ultimately depends on your use case
2018-09-28 05:28:50	+yossarian	i keep a lot of things in kbsecret, including my code snippets
2018-09-28 05:29:12	+dysfigured	i keep my passwords in a private repo on gitlab, i should probably consider keybase
2018-09-28 05:29:41	+yossarian	yeah, keeping things in a private repo is probably not ideal
2018-09-28 05:29:49	+yossarian	i doubt it's encrypted server-side
2018-09-28 05:30:46	+dysfigured	i mean probably not at all, but they're pgp encrypted and (almost all) randomly generated
2018-09-28 05:30:54	+yossarian	oh, that's good then
2018-09-28 05:31:03	+yossarian	in that case, it's fine
2018-09-28 05:31:20	+yossarian	and in some ways preferable, since you don't need a chunky keybase client
2018-09-28 05:31:32	+yossarian	i wrote kbsecret about a year ago, i'm not sure that i would do it again
2018-09-28 05:31:35	+yossarian	it has a lot of downsides
2018-09-28 05:32:08	+dysfigured	i think i've lost my keybase password like twice now
2018-09-28 05:32:13	+yossarian	heh

2018-09-28 05:33:20	+dysfigured	doesn't the first leave all your passwords in your clipboard history?
2018-09-28 05:33:51	+yossarian	i think i implemented a clearing process
2018-09-28 05:33:56	+yossarian	don't remember, though
2018-09-28 05:34:29	+yossarian	nope, looks like i didn't, so yes
2018-09-28 05:34:51	+brooks	uh
2018-09-28 05:34:53	+dysfigured	pass show | xdotool type --clearmodifiers --file -
2018-09-28 05:34:59	+brooks	^
2018-09-28 05:35:00	+brooks	yes
2018-09-28 05:35:02	+brooks	this
2018-09-28 05:35:04	+brooks	my passmenu does this
2018-09-28 05:35:08	+winny	yall cool dudes
2018-09-28 05:35:17	+yossarian	yeah, i'll add that tomorrow
2018-09-28 05:35:35	+dysfigured	i actually use a weird hack because that doesn't work exactly like how you want
2018-09-28 05:35:56	+dysfigured	pass show "$password" | { read -r pass; printf %s "$pass"; } | xdotool type --clearmodifiers --file -
2018-09-28 05:35:57	+brooks	what do you want different
2018-09-28 05:36:02	+yossarian	i thought `pass` had a clipboard timeout
2018-09-28 05:36:09	+yossarian	it was one of the things i was going to copy
2018-09-28 05:36:21	+dysfigured	i think it does but i still didn't like my passwords being in my clipboard at all if i could help it
2018-09-28 05:36:22	+brooks	oh oh
2018-09-28 05:36:23	+brooks	I don't do that
2018-09-28 05:36:28	+brooks	I use this
2018-09-28 05:36:39	+brooks	o-oh
2018-09-28 05:36:40	+brooks	I do that too
2018-09-28 05:36:43	+dysfigured	lmao
2018-09-28 05:36:43	+brooks	but it's slightly different
2018-09-28 05:37:04	+dysfigured	plz paste i hate it so much anything must be better
2018-09-28 05:37:07	+brooks	pass show "$password" | { IFS= read -r pass; printf %s "$pass"; } | xdotool type --clearmodifiers --file -
2018-09-28 05:37:09	+dysfigured	than
2018-09-28 05:37:11	+brooks	it's the same
2018-09-28 05:37:12	+dysfigured	k
2018-09-28 05:37:15	+brooks	kek
2018-09-28 05:38:27	+brooks	just the IFS difference
2018-09-28 05:38:38	+dysfigured	yeah.. i think.. i could do..
2018-09-28 05:39:23	+dysfigured	read -r pass < <(pass show "$userinput"); xdotool type --clearmodifiers --file "$pass"
2018-09-28 05:40:00	+dysfigured	but then.. i think xdotool would show the pass in the process list, in htop ps etc
2018-09-28 05:42:09	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-28 05:42:11	+brooks	it would
2018-09-28 05:42:30	+brooks	the variable also might clean differently
2018-09-28 05:47:46	+brooks	actually
2018-09-28 05:47:55	+brooks	we should probably throw in something to clean it explicitly

2018-09-28 08:03:22	+trinary	brooks - One approach is xpra, but it's just a component, not a full sandboxing solution
2018-09-28 08:03:48	+trinary	brooks - You can look at subuser, which uses xpra. There are probably other projects
2018-09-28 08:03:49	+brooks	I want to protect it from the host, instead of the other way around
2018-09-28 08:03:57	+brooks	is that possible with xpra?
2018-09-28 08:04:00	+trinary	Oh
2018-09-28 08:04:02	+brooks	I was under the impression it wasn't

2018-09-28 08:05:30	+brooks	I *think* firejail does this
2018-09-28 08:05:35	+brooks	but I might just be misunderstanding
2018-09-28 08:05:40	+trinary	I don't see how it would

2018-09-28 08:06:18	+trinary	brooks - Maybe use Wayland :/
2018-09-28 08:06:22	+brooks	if nothing else, xpra and xephyr will be options here
2018-09-28 08:06:29	+brooks	;_;
2018-09-28 08:06:42	+brooks	I don't want to use wayland!
2018-09-28 08:07:02	+trinary	Only on the host, not the server/guest
2018-09-28 08:07:59	+trinary	brooks - In "I don't want myself to be able to eavesdrop", does "myself" have root?
2018-09-28 08:08:42	+Nux	brooks: proxy that vm's taffic to another vm, it could at least hide actual source from packet sniffs
2018-09-28 08:08:52	+brooks	nah @ root
2018-09-28 08:09:01	+brooks	...presumably
2018-09-28 08:11:35	+trinary	I don't think you can
2018-09-28 08:11:50	+trinary	But I'm not familiar with X security measurees
2018-09-28 08:12:02	+trinary	You can try using https://github.com/cyrus-and/xkeylogger with firejail

2018-09-28 08:17:13	+trinary	I understand that desire, but I strongly urge you to use actual Qubes instead of duplicating it in a subtly-broken manner and feeling confident about your system
2018-09-28 08:18:31	+trinary	There may a way to tame X here, but I don't know it, and X is too complex for me to feel secure with

2018-09-28 17:00:07	+Kirjava	is it D:
2018-09-28 17:00:12	+Kirjava	the cringe in the morning is less so
2018-09-28 17:00:47	+trinary	Maybe you should require solving a math exercise to unlock weechat
2018-09-28 17:01:14	+Kirjava	nah I'd still manage that
2018-09-28 17:01:29	+Kirjava	needs a reaction time tester isntead
2018-09-28 17:02:26	+trinary	Like here: http://random.irb.hr/signup.php
2018-09-28 17:02:42	+Kirjava	lmao
2018-09-28 17:02:44	+trinary	Reload a few times for different examples
2018-09-28 17:03:00	+Kirjava	yeah that's great
2018-09-28 17:03:09	+Kirjava	does it always show a tricky one 
2018-09-28 17:03:14	+Kirjava	like, first
2018-09-28 17:03:51	+trinary	No idea
2018-09-28 17:04:12	+trinary	It does say so, but... can't verify
2018-09-28 17:04:46	+Kirjava	I wonder if it actually accepts the right answer for the ones that require differenciation
2018-09-28 17:05:00	+Kirjava	*differentiation
2018-09-28 17:05:19	+trinary	Now you have to try. Drunk
2018-09-28 17:05:42	+Kirjava	easy
2018-09-28 17:05:48	+Kirjava	just let me talk a refresher first

2018-09-28 17:07:14	+brooks	I-I get on irc drunk a lot
2018-09-28 17:07:16	+brooks	l-lmao
2018-09-28 17:07:25	+Kirjava	you lot are playing a dangerous game goading me like this
2018-09-28 17:07:30	+brooks	have fun @ festival
2018-09-28 17:07:44	+Kirjava	weechat sucks to use on my mobile compared to irssi anyway
2018-09-28 17:07:53	+trinary	So use Revolution IRC!
2018-09-28 17:07:59	+brooks	revolution irc is pretty decent 
2018-09-28 17:08:03	+Kirjava	:O
2018-09-28 17:08:13	+brooks	I love weechat-android though
2018-09-28 17:08:16	+Kirjava	this sounds promising
2018-09-28 17:09:38	+Kirjava	oh i assumed revolution connected to weechat or something
2018-09-28 17:09:45	+Kirjava	don't really wanna use another client
2018-09-28 17:09:47	+brooks	oh nope unfortunately not
2018-09-28 17:09:49	+brooks	after like
2018-09-28 17:09:54	+brooks	android 5
2018-09-28 17:10:02	+brooks	people stopped making cool shit and apps are sporadic
2018-09-28 17:10:20	+Kirjava	weechat-android looks like what I want
2018-09-28 17:11:00	+brooks	oh probably
2018-09-28 17:11:03	+brooks	it connects over the weechat relay
2018-09-28 17:11:08	+Kirjava	which I'd need to ssetup
2018-09-28 17:11:15	+brooks	it's easy to setup
2018-09-28 17:11:16	+Kirjava	I haven't even fixed the existing bugs in my setup
2018-09-28 17:11:23	+Kirjava	I should probably do that first
2018-09-28 17:15:17	+brooks	I wonder why tf weechat doesn't support connecting over its own relay
2018-09-28 17:17:56	+brooks	relays basically have two modes
2018-09-28 17:18:05	+brooks	the weechat relay mode or the irc server mode
2018-09-28 17:18:13	+brooks	in the latter it basically works like a bouncer
2018-09-28 17:18:21	+brooks	except all your plugins work
2018-09-28 17:18:36	+brooks	existing plugins
2018-09-28 17:19:00	+brooks	I use the relay protocol but I bind it to localhost and connect with an ssh tunnel
2018-09-28 17:22:48	+Kirjava	what are the differences between them
2018-09-28 17:22:54	+Kirjava	you described irc server mode only
2018-09-28 17:24:34	+brooks	ah, right
2018-09-28 17:26:14	+brooks	it's kinda like you're doing tmux attach
2018-09-28 17:26:14	+brooks	the protocol describes how the screen should look, or something like that
2018-09-28 17:26:14	+brooks	it's not as seamless as that, but it's similar in concept I guess
2018-09-28 17:26:52	+Kirjava	aaah, I see
2018-09-28 17:27:16	+Kirjava	so it it's less of a thin client and more just like a remote viewer
2018-09-28 17:27:44	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-28 17:27:49	+brooks	daily reminder
2018-09-28 17:28:09	+brooks	that find(1) is trash
2018-09-28 17:28:16	+trinary	Speaking of thin clients...

2018-09-28 17:28:19	+Kirjava	2 mins until the weekend
2018-09-28 17:28:39	+trinary	Does anyone have experience with seamless forwarding of a desktop?
2018-09-28 17:29:04	+brooks	what's the difference between: find . -delete -iname '*.webm' and find . -iname '*.webm' -delete
2018-09-28 17:29:11	+Kirjava	nerp
2018-09-28 17:29:11	+brooks	the first one deletes everything

2018-09-28 17:47:17	+brooks	Rob Pike - It's a different kind of mess, and for different reasons, but the Unix/POSIX/Linux systems of today are messier, clumsier, and more complex than the systems the original Unix was designed to replace.
2018-09-28 17:47:19	+brooks	It started to go wrong when the BSD signal stuff went in (I complained at the time), then symlinks, sockets, X11 windowing, and so on, none of which were added with proper appreciation of the Unix model and its simplifications.
2018-09-28 17:47:21	+brooks	So let the whiners whine: you're right, and they don't know what they're missing. Unfortunately, I do, and I miss it terribly.

2018-09-28 18:53:13	+dysfigured	like LambdaComplex has said this a lot as well, and i'm curious what it is that makes it difficult, is it their api or what
2018-09-28 18:53:39	+darkwater	it's working with futures and streams
2018-09-28 18:53:45	+darkwater	the combinator stuff
2018-09-28 18:53:48	+dysfigured	also also, does rust have async iterators

2018-09-28 18:54:51	+dysfigured	i am glad to here this, and maybe i'll reconsider it when it figures this stuff out

2018-09-28 18:55:20	+darkwater	await/async should help a LOT
2018-09-28 18:55:38	+dysfigured	does rust have generators?
2018-09-28 18:55:45	+darkwater	also in nightly
2018-09-28 18:55:57	+darkwater	there's a crate that implements async/await using generators

2018-09-28 18:56:15	+darkwater	heh

2018-09-28 19:28:38	+trinary	brooks - JS has async/await, Rust doesn't yet
2018-09-28 19:29:22	+brooks	ah I thought they meant with them
2018-09-28 19:38:13	+dysfigured	js has a really good async story, with promises and async await being first class features
2018-09-28 19:39:42	+dysfigured	you can even a implement monadic Futures using generators ( https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture )
2018-09-28 19:40:49	+dysfigured	i wonder if rust will use map/flatmap or do some dumb js shit and overload both into a single operator
2018-09-28 19:43:42	+dysfigured	it already uses .then .and_then right
2018-09-28 19:44:11	+dysfigured	or is that just tokio

2018-09-28 22:59:33	+bdelloid	maybe we're getting type families
2018-09-28 22:59:37	+bdelloid	but it's such a low priority
2018-09-28 22:59:45	+brooks	sounds like go and generics
2018-09-28 22:59:47	+bdelloid	and it's going to be so hard to teach to retards that it's never gonna get merged
2018-09-28 23:00:06	+brooks	iirc one of the objections they had was that proving correctness gets harder?
2018-09-28 23:00:14	+bdelloid	a lot of things get harder
2018-09-28 23:00:24	+bdelloid	because it allows you to do hard things more easily

2018-09-28 23:38:57	+bdelloid	darkwater, it's a generic over a generic
2018-09-28 23:39:08	+darkwater	can you give me an example?
2018-09-28 23:39:12	+bdelloid	darkwater, yeah, gimme a sec
2018-09-28 23:40:08	+bdelloid	for example in the Deref trait
2018-09-28 23:40:21	+bdelloid	the Target type is just a type right?
2018-09-28 23:40:27	+bdelloid	but you want to take a type that's generic
2018-09-28 23:40:32	+bdelloid	for instance with some fancy syntax
2018-09-28 23:40:51	+bdelloid	you'd have `type Target<'a, T>`
2018-09-28 23:41:11	+bdelloid	and `fn deref<'a>(&'a self) -> Target<'a, whatever>`
2018-09-28 23:41:21	+bdelloid	then Deref would be able to return MutexGuard and whatever else
2018-09-28 23:41:26	+Kirjava	impl trait for params was a mistake
2018-09-28 23:41:32	+bdelloid	because you're taking a type T that takes a lifetime 'a and and a type T
2018-09-28 23:41:42	+bdelloid	so MutexGuard<'a, T> is T<'a, U>
2018-09-28 23:41:47	+bdelloid	but so is Ref<'a, T> from RefCell
2018-09-28 23:41:52	+bdelloid	and so is whatever else the fuck you want
2018-09-28 23:42:01	+bdelloid	so it's a higher kinded type because it's a type that's generic over types
2018-09-28 23:42:13	+bdelloid	gotta go now
2018-09-28 23:42:18	+bdelloid	last words
2018-09-28 23:42:20	+darkwater	so you could return any T with type params 'a and U?
2018-09-28 23:42:24	+bdelloid	with HKT we can get fancy collection traits
2018-09-28 23:42:26	+bdelloid	yes
2018-09-28 23:42:35	+bdelloid	any type T that's generic over 'a and U
2018-09-28 23:42:40	+bdelloid	byeeee

2018-09-28 23:43:00	+darkwater	i think i just need to get into haskell someday
2018-09-28 23:44:58	+brooks	would it make sense if I said the term is derived from 'higher order functions' and "kinds" are the types of types?
2018-09-28 23:45:16	+brooks	it's just meta on the types instead of on the functions

2018-09-29 00:44:18	+kyubiko	I have loadsa friends with anxiety but the difference is they're actually likeable and have huge amounts of friends
2018-09-29 00:45:08	+kyubiko	The funny thing is everyone knows I'm an awkward fuck who doesn't know many people but they just think "that's who he is" and can't put two and two together and realise what a sad existence that is

2018-09-29 02:41:05	+yossarian	but a pipeline is a subshell, so `read`'s assignments get silently discarded

2018-09-29 03:37:54	+isk	what's the difference between myserver and remotehost
2018-09-29 03:38:36	+brooks	remote host is the ip addr available to your own machine
2018-09-29 03:38:41	+brooks	wait no
2018-09-29 03:38:42	+brooks	ok
2018-09-29 03:38:56	+brooks	it's an ip addr available to myserver
2018-09-29 03:39:01	+brooks	so e.g. another machine on its LAN
2018-09-29 03:39:11	+brooks	usually, you want localhost
2018-09-29 03:39:22	+brooks	but it might be a hostname or an ip
2018-09-29 03:40:28	+brooks	if you don't need localhost, you probably already know you don't
2018-09-29 03:40:47	+brooks	but it could be bound to a specific ip on myserver, instead of all of them
2018-09-29 03:42:42	+brooks	does that make sense
2018-09-29 03:47:00	+isk	brooks: any advice on nested SSH tunneling
2018-09-29 03:47:12	+isk	I can ssh to my machine at work
2018-09-29 03:47:18	+isk	it's a mac so it doesn't have x11 firefox
2018-09-29 03:47:25	+isk	but I need to get to a webpage within the vpn
2018-09-29 03:48:50	+brooks	if you have the IP for the webpage, you can bind that port from your machine
2018-09-29 03:48:53	+brooks	web server, ig
2018-09-29 03:49:05	+brooks	so you'd do like
2018-09-29 03:49:22	+brooks	ssh -L 80:ipwithwebpage:80 myname@work
2018-09-29 03:49:34	+isk	well
2018-09-29 03:49:41	+isk	I need to go to a different gateway machine
2018-09-29 03:49:55	+isk	so it's ssh machine1 -> ssh mac
2018-09-29 03:50:13	+isk	can't bind to a port that's bound to a port
2018-09-29 03:50:13	+brooks	I don't know how to chain, but I'm pretty sure there's a way
2018-09-29 03:50:15	+brooks	*but*
2018-09-29 03:51:08	+brooks	if you can run ssh from machine1, you use ssh -L from it, and then again from home machine
2018-09-29 03:51:41	+brooks	or uh actually
2018-09-29 03:51:46	+isk	but ultimately I want to route traffic to my laptop at home
2018-09-29 03:51:53	+isk	laptop -> gateway -> mac
2018-09-29 03:52:40	+brooks	hm
2018-09-29 03:52:52	+brooks	why do you need to use your mac?
2018-09-29 03:53:05	+isk	ldap
2018-09-29 03:53:21	+isk	website I'm using auto logs in based on the machine that's accessing
2018-09-29 03:53:37	+isk	really I just need to get some info from a page
2018-09-29 03:53:42	+isk	a wiki type thing
2018-09-29 03:53:49	+isk	ironically it's on how to do this
2018-09-29 03:53:53	+isk	so it's kind of a chicken and egg problem
2018-09-29 03:54:06	+isk	but the page talks about how to install PIV card drivers on loonix
2018-09-29 03:57:58	+brooks	if you can make it to your mac, then the -L should use the mac to forward traffic between the two ports
2018-09-29 03:58:12	+brooks	from laptop -> gateway -> mac -> web server
2018-09-29 03:58:17	+brooks	*I* think
2018-09-29 03:59:26	+brooks	oops, emphasized the wrong word
2018-09-29 04:14:23	+isk	but
2018-09-29 04:14:29	+isk	don't I have to -L at each step
2018-09-29 04:14:43	+isk	that's what I'm confused about
2018-09-29 04:15:14	+isk	ssh -L p1:u1@h1:p2 h2 'ssh -L p2:u2@h2:p3 h3'
2018-09-29 04:15:23	+isk	I have no idea how this syntax is supposed to look
2018-09-29 04:16:41	+brooks	I don't think so
2018-09-29 04:17:08	+brooks	you already have a connection going all the way through, so the forwarding should just work
2018-09-29 04:19:12	+isk	but
2018-09-29 04:19:17	+isk	hm
2018-09-29 04:19:25	+brooks	oh

2018-09-29 20:39:13	+LambdaComplex	So I just thought of something
2018-09-29 20:39:23	+LambdaComplex	Does pinging stuff count as a CFAA violation?
2018-09-29 20:39:31	+LambdaComplex	I'm pretty damn sure port scans do
2018-09-29 20:39:34	+LambdaComplex	So....why not ping?
2018-09-29 20:39:59	+brooks	port scans actually access running services to see what they are, I'm guessing
2018-09-29 20:40:10	+LambdaComplex	Not really?
2018-09-29 20:40:19	+LambdaComplex	I mean, you're checking to see if there's something bound to that port
2018-09-29 20:40:28	+LambdaComplex	That'd be a really loose definition of "access" though
2018-09-29 20:40:38	+brooks	but the real answer is probably "lawmakers and law enforcement don't understand shit and/or are taking advantage of the 'shady' nature of port scans to justify action in cases where they want someone"
2018-09-29 20:40:39	+LambdaComplex	I've run sshd on port 80 before!!!
2018-09-29 20:40:43	+brooks	i.e.

2018-09-29 20:43:41	+LambdaComplex	wikipedia says apache 2 license though
2018-09-29 20:43:51	+LambdaComplex	does this mean the code and the binaries are distributed with different licenses?
2018-09-29 20:44:11	+brooks	yeah, which is fine
2018-09-29 20:44:17	+brooks	just compile it and it's your binary instead of theirs

2018-09-29 20:45:35	+brooks	fairly standard ...theory
2018-09-29 20:45:43	+brooks	I'm not sure it's actually standard practice, but it gets talked about a lot

2018-09-29 20:46:33	+LambdaComplex	I'm kinda confused tbh
2018-09-29 20:46:56	+LambdaComplex	Like, I think they have some "premium" versions that are proprietary with additional features? Like nginx
2018-09-29 20:47:21	+LambdaComplex	Oh, nevermind

2018-09-29 20:47:35	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-29 20:47:39	+brooks	this is how you make money selling foss
2018-09-29 20:47:45	+LambdaComplex	the commercial licenses come with support though
2018-09-29 20:47:51	+brooks	I prefer gplv3 tho
2018-09-29 20:47:59	+brooks	well
2018-09-29 20:48:03	+brooks	I guess you can do this with that too
2018-09-29 20:48:05	+brooks	yeah, kk
2018-09-29 20:48:21	+LambdaComplex	i think i like this better than nginx's model tbh
2018-09-29 20:48:30	+brooks	what is nginx's
2018-09-29 20:48:55	+LambdaComplex	https://www.nginx.com/blog/whats-difference-nginx-foss-nginx-plus/
2018-09-29 20:49:15	+LambdaComplex	>To increase the value of the commercial product, we add in features that make it easier to manage and monitor. A good example is the live activity monitoring data that NGINX Plus generates; another is the on‑the‑fly reconfiguration of load‑balanced groups of upstream servers.
2018-09-29 20:49:25	+LambdaComplex	>We’re building out the application delivery capabilities of NGINX Plus. The session persistence and health monitoring capabilities we added are good examples of this. NGINX Plus is incorporating features that you wouldn’t expect to see in a web server – things that move it into the domain of load balancers or application delivery controllers.
2018-09-29 20:49:45	+LambdaComplex	tldr pay and you get more features
2018-09-29 20:49:59	+LambdaComplex	but let's be real, even the open source nginx is absolutely amazing
2018-09-29 20:50:09	+brooks	tbf it had a low bar
2018-09-29 20:50:14	+brooks	but yes I agree
2018-09-29 20:50:24	+LambdaComplex	are you comparing it to apache
2018-09-29 20:50:28	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-29 20:50:28	+LambdaComplex	if so: u rite
2018-09-29 20:50:30	+LambdaComplex	u rite
2018-09-29 20:50:32	+brooks	thank u
2018-09-29 20:50:45	+brooks	I do prefer the other approach
2018-09-29 20:51:18	+brooks	I REALLY prefer the "this is free and open source unless you are a company with employees and then you have to pay for a commercial license" approach though tbqh
2018-09-29 20:51:31	+brooks	cooperatives don't pay, collectives don't pay, but companies employing wage labor pay
2018-09-29 20:51:38	+brooks	as they should and as they expect to in pretty much any other case
2018-09-29 20:51:58	+LambdaComplex	caddy's isn't even that though. it's "this is free and open source unless you don't feel like compiling binaries and/or want support"
2018-09-29 20:52:01	+brooks	unreal's approach is pretty okay though
2018-09-29 20:52:03	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-29 20:52:16	+brooks	that's what i meant, I like caddy's but not as much as this
2018-09-29 20:52:16	+LambdaComplex	open source, don't pay them until you hit xxxxx profit?
2018-09-29 20:52:23	+brooks	yeah that's unreal's
2018-09-29 20:52:29	+LambdaComplex	yeeee
2018-09-29 20:52:43	+brooks	there's a more general version to that one being called "copyfair" where you pay if your company is a certain size
2018-09-29 20:52:48	+brooks	but I actually hate that one
2018-09-29 20:53:04	+LambdaComplex	fun fact: my employer's old office is in a building that epic games has an office in
2018-09-29 20:53:09	+LambdaComplex	i think they do beta testing there. not sure
2018-09-29 20:53:21	+trinary	I used to like nginx a lot, but now I'm not so sure anymore
2018-09-29 20:53:23	+brooks	in the case of unreal, it's kinda like, "we'll do everything we can to get you to the point of earning profit, then you pay us back if it pans out"
2018-09-29 20:53:44	+LambdaComplex	trinary: Why's that?
2018-09-29 20:53:56	+brooks	I'm curious too
2018-09-29 20:55:03	+trinary	LambdaComplex - You invest into the free version until you need "advanced features" ("advanced", like health checks or ldap acl), and then you're stuck. They intentionally keep features out of the free version
2018-09-29 20:55:37	+dysfigured	brooks: am now
2018-09-29 20:55:39	+brooks	ah, yeah, that's what I dislike about that approach
2018-09-29 20:56:39	+brooks	dysfigured: I wanted to pass this along since I commented on it the other day. there's a zsh program called "tomb" which uses luks (cryptsetup) to encrypt 'containers' in the form of .tomb files
2018-09-29 20:56:54	+dysfigured	LambdaComplex: i like caddy, i would probably switch to it or similar from nginx if i could figure out to do all the fancy regex rewrites i can do in nginx
2018-09-29 20:57:03	+dysfigured	brooks: yeah i've seen it
2018-09-29 20:57:23	+brooks	dysfigured: one of the things it does is overwrite and unset sensitive variables. I decided to incorporate it into my passmenu. I wrote a function which does the read/print and pip into it. it's a little cleaner as a result
2018-09-29 20:57:41	+brooks	it steals the tomb overwriting stuff outright
2018-09-29 20:57:54	+dysfigured	paste?
2018-09-29 20:58:01	+brooks	 local rr="$RANDOM"

2018-09-29 21:02:54	+brooks	thought about it before I said it tbh
2018-09-29 21:03:16	+dysfigured	i feel like that about my cheap chinese android
2018-09-29 21:03:33	+brooks	read about intel management engine
2018-09-29 21:03:35	+brooks	get on my level
2018-09-29 21:04:17	+yossarian	nation states don't after RNGs if they can get away with backdooring the baseband or the OS itself
2018-09-29 21:04:24	+yossarian	which is a lot easier, at least in china's case
2018-09-29 21:04:49	+yossarian	no point in making the RNG predictable if you control the functions that access it
2018-09-29 21:06:36	+dysfigured	i only say it because shuffling my music often seems to be less..random than i'd expect, like maybe i just imagine but sometimes it starts with the same few songs
2018-09-29 21:07:07	+yossarian	that's intentional, people complain about truly random shuffles
2018-09-29 21:07:16	+yossarian	most music players use fisher-yates or another linear shuffle
2018-09-29 21:07:40	+brooks	was about to say, that always happens
2018-09-29 21:07:46	+yossarian	i remember when they changed it in itunes, in like 2005 or so
2018-09-29 21:08:03	+yossarian	it's funny how that works, people complain about their music not being random enough if it actually is random
2018-09-29 21:08:14	+dysfigured	how tf does that happen
2018-09-29 21:08:47	+dysfigured	"shuffle my music" "no not like that, less shuffly, less random" all of my wut
2018-09-29 21:08:55	+yossarian	dysfigured: if you have a playlist of 10 songs and have shuffled 5 songs so far, most people expect that the 6th song won't be one of the first 5
2018-09-29 21:09:26	+yossarian	i.e., most people have a gambler's view of randomness
2018-09-29 21:09:46	+brooks	I prefer shuffle to be "here's a random order for the entire playlist, it's determined from this point" and then you can skip back and forth between songs reliably
2018-09-29 21:09:56	+yossarian	yeah, i prefer that too
2018-09-29 21:10:06	+dysfigured	yes, that's what i mean
2018-09-29 21:10:56	+dysfigured	actually idk what i mean, ignore me

2018-09-30 00:42:37	+mobo	it's not a language so much as a standard 
2018-09-30 00:42:45	+LambdaComplex	yeah but it sucks
2018-09-30 00:42:52	+LambdaComplex	it doesn't even have arrays
2018-09-30 00:43:01	+mobo	arrays are bloat
2018-09-30 00:43:08	+LambdaComplex	then why does C have them?
2018-09-30 00:43:13	+mobo	...fuck
2018-09-30 00:43:18	+Kirjava	lmao
2018-09-30 00:43:35	+mobo	because scripting languages are different than compiled languages
2018-09-30 00:43:35	+mobo	there
2018-09-30 00:43:41	+mobo	recovered that nicely
2018-09-30 00:43:46	+brooks	this is pretty much what I expected
2018-09-30 00:44:04	+brooks	I like you mobo but being on 10 levels of irony every time a serious conversation comes up makes it hard to connect with u
2018-09-30 00:44:14	+LambdaComplex	why is it okay for scripting languages to be different from compiled languages but not for some compiled languages to be different than others?
2018-09-30 00:44:22	+mobo	the only thing I have ironic conversations about is programming languages
2018-09-30 00:44:48	+mobo	I know what you mean though
2018-09-30 00:44:50	+LambdaComplex	yes and you are in a channel that is about programming
2018-09-30 00:44:57	+LambdaComplex	....more or less
2018-09-30 00:44:58	+mobo	yeah
2018-09-30 00:45:06	+Kirjava	shit I thought this channel was all about codeine
2018-09-30 00:45:10	+LambdaComplex	except when it's about fully-automated luxury gay space communism
2018-09-30 00:45:12	+brooks	that too
2018-09-30 00:45:35	+brooks	I am actually against fully automated luxury * space communism but don't tell my mom
2018-09-30 00:46:02	+mobo	get out
2018-09-30 00:46:43	+LambdaComplex	no u
2018-09-30 00:49:22	+Kirjava	mobo: there are many variants of C. are they all good?
2018-09-30 00:49:32	+yossarian	hmm
2018-09-30 00:49:44	+mobo	yeah
2018-09-30 00:49:45	+yossarian	maybe i'll do a coding livestream tonight
2018-09-30 00:49:59	+Kirjava	mobo: even K&R's inferior param syntax?
2018-09-30 00:50:04	+mobo	yeah
2018-09-30 00:51:19	--	Coswater is now known as Cosumu
2018-09-30 00:51:45	+Kirjava	mobo: what about the fact that it doesn't support casts as lvalues
2018-09-30 00:51:50	+mobo	yeah
2018-09-30 00:51:55	+Kirjava	well I made that up
2018-09-30 00:52:02	+Kirjava	so I think you don't know what you're talking about
2018-09-30 00:52:28	+mobo	did you think my 'yeah' was an actual response? 
2018-09-30 00:53:07	+Kirjava	I'm just confirming that it wasn't and you're not being serious :)
2018-09-30 00:53:07	+LambdaComplex	yeah
2018-09-30 00:53:29	+mobo	yeah.
2018-09-30 00:53:49	+mobo	what variant does clang use anyways?
2018-09-30 00:53:51	+mobo	ansi c?
2018-09-30 00:53:59	+mobo	c99
2018-09-30 00:54:05	+Cosumu	/me screams 
2018-09-30 00:54:11	+mobo	I can't keep track of them
2018-09-30 00:55:04	+mobo	I prefer the plan9 c
2018-09-30 00:55:12	+mobo	actually no I can't use that one
2018-09-30 00:57:06	+Cosumu	> not using lispc
2018-09-30 00:57:32	+Cosumu	mobo: is the lovefort still active?
2018-09-30 00:57:37	+mobo	no

2018-09-30 01:12:45	+winny	mobo: tbh it doesn't matter cuz if u don't specify -std u don't deserve a compiler

2018-09-30 01:13:31	+winny	i wrote scathing feedback for a cs instructor for reasons related to that sort of thing
2018-09-30 01:13:42	+winny	went to a cs meet & greet and we didn't taalk to each other
2018-09-30 01:14:10	+winny	i take my C education pretty seriously
2018-09-30 01:15:23	+mobo	nice
2018-09-30 01:15:52	+winny	i've since sort of given up on giving feedback to people like that
2018-09-30 01:16:03	+winny	waste of my thoughts
2018-09-30 01:31:37	+isk	how would one go about
2018-09-30 01:31:45	+isk	getting audio data from a streaming process
2018-09-30 01:31:55	+isk	to pipe into a terminal-based music visualizer
2018-09-30 01:31:59	+isk	（ °‿ゝ°）
2018-09-30 01:32:18	+winny	actually
2018-09-30 01:32:20	+isk	could be raw bitrate, doesn't matter, just something I can run FFTs on
2018-09-30 01:32:27	+winny	Kirjava recently did that in rust with pulseaudio
2018-09-30 01:32:31	+isk	welp
2018-09-30 01:32:39	+isk	I was gonna do it in c+
2018-09-30 01:32:47	+isk	Kirjava: link
2018-09-30 01:32:52	+isk	can I hook it into mpv?
2018-09-30 01:33:08	+winny	u might like cava
2018-09-30 01:33:17	+winny	it's probably similar to your aspirations
2018-09-30 01:34:13	+isk	>mpd
2018-09-30 01:34:14	+isk	hahahaha
2018-09-30 01:34:21	+isk	yeah this a good start
2018-09-30 01:34:25	+winny	cava hooks into pulseaudio
2018-09-30 01:34:26	+isk	but I want to write something cooler
2018-09-30 01:34:36	+isk	I have no idea what I have but I assume it's pulse
2018-09-30 01:35:23	+isk	welp looks like I gotta use yaourtr
2018-09-30 01:35:35	+winny	i
2018-09-30 01:35:36	+winny	isk: 
2018-09-30 01:35:38	+winny	n o
2018-09-30 01:35:40	+winny	pls no yaourt
2018-09-30 01:35:46	+isk	well it ain't on octopi
2018-09-30 01:35:48	+isk	:|
2018-09-30 01:36:05	+winny	rather, yaourt is a pretty unfortunate aur helper
2018-09-30 01:36:11	+winny	u might like aurman
2018-09-30 01:36:33	+winny	crazy french people making insecure software and pushing it like mad
2018-09-30 01:42:24	+isk	ugh
2018-09-30 01:42:36	+isk	how do I make yaourt not care about pgp signatures
2018-09-30 01:45:16	+brooks	y-you shouldn't do that
2018-09-30 01:45:27	+brooks	good way to get hax0red
2018-09-30 01:45:56	+LambdaComplex	>2018
2018-09-30 01:45:58	+LambdaComplex	>using yaourt
2018-09-30 01:46:14	+LambdaComplex	this is Ungood
2018-09-30 01:46:33	+winny	isk: that's not a yaourt issue - that's an issue with makepkg needing to verify stuff
2018-09-30 01:46:39	+isk	yeah
2018-09-30 01:46:42	+isk	so I'm seeing
2018-09-30 01:46:56	+winny	tbh eventually u should use aurutils and build packages much like the devs do
2018-09-30 01:47:07	+isk	I have
2018-09-30 01:47:09	+winny	cuz the way yaourt and most helpers do it are terrible
2018-09-30 01:47:15	+isk	but then it is difficult to update shit
2018-09-30 01:47:16	+LambdaComplex	winny: is yay terrible
2018-09-30 01:47:18	+winny	isk: i mean with a clean chroot
2018-09-30 01:47:28	+yossarian	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAWlF8nVN_c stream should be running correctly now
2018-09-30 01:47:28	+meep	"[Ruby] Creating a stable branch for CocoaPods"
2018-09-30 01:47:33	+isk	I was never able to get chroot to run successfully

2018-09-30 01:47:46	+winny	isk: there are some helper tools because it's sort of messy
2018-09-30 01:47:52	+isk	well to be specific
2018-09-30 01:47:59	+isk	I never got chroot to run and be able to still use ls
2018-09-30 01:48:06	+winny	also it's really not your fault, archlinux is just a terrible distro to do reliably and correctly every time
2018-09-30 01:49:41	+isk	still the comfiest distro
2018-09-30 01:50:30	+winny	been using gentoo but i'm not entirely confident it's the best choice for my uses - nixos is probably the best
2018-09-30 01:52:42	+Arathnim	Hi winny
2018-09-30 01:53:06	+winny	jw what distro/wm do u use Arathnim 
2018-09-30 01:53:12	+winny	v curious
2018-09-30 01:53:29	+Arathnim	emacs
2018-09-30 01:53:32	+winny	:DD
2018-09-30 01:53:54	+isk	kek
2018-09-30 01:55:15	+LambdaComplex	wew
2018-09-30 01:55:34	 *	winny pressures Arathnim to tell all the secrets
2018-09-30 01:59:21	+brooks	have u checked out guixsd yet
2018-09-30 02:00:03	+winny	it's on my list
2018-09-30 02:00:07	+winny	i like how it has infopages
2018-09-30 02:00:12	+winny	infopages master race
2018-09-30 02:00:44	+brooks	oh I meant Arathnim because of that answer, but same
2018-09-30 02:00:48	+winny	lol
2018-09-30 02:00:59	+brooks	my problem with infopages is the emacs-like stuff. I can't into emacs
2018-09-30 02:02:00	+Arathnim	It's alright. The configuration stuff is interesting, but it still has the linux executable thing, so it's not fully lisp, which limits how much configuration can be abstracted.
2018-09-30 02:02:18	+brooks	rip
2018-09-30 02:02:20	+brooks	good answer
2018-09-30 02:02:21	+isk	nice
2018-09-30 02:02:25	+isk	was able to import the key
2018-09-30 02:02:34	+winny	brooks: infopages isn't realy emacs
2018-09-30 02:02:46	+winny	:3
2018-09-30 02:02:53	+brooks	I said -like!
2018-09-30 02:03:03	+brooks	it's confusing to use, and makes me want it to be vim instead
2018-09-30 02:03:09	+brooks	(my manpages are vim now)
2018-09-30 02:03:15	+brooks	(and have hyperlinks)
2018-09-30 02:03:17	+winny	manpages for most GNU programs are missing a great deal of stuff that are in infopages
2018-09-30 02:03:21	+brooks	yep
2018-09-30 02:03:26	+brooks	it's frustrating as h*ck
2018-09-30 02:03:39	+winny	hmm
2018-09-30 02:03:46	+winny	nobody wrote a texinfo viewer for vim?
2018-09-30 02:03:48	+brooks	I'll just suck it up and learn it
2018-09-30 02:03:53	+brooks	they probably did
2018-09-30 02:04:00	+brooks	I'd be surprised if they didn't
2018-09-30 02:04:34	+gnu	don't neglect to feed your pets
2018-09-30 02:10:14	+winny	brooks: the info(1) stand alone viewer is pretty simple, i think it has a vi mode too
2018-09-30 02:10:41	+mobo	info is gnushit
2018-09-30 02:11:02	+winny	oh hm
2018-09-30 02:11:04	+winny	maybe not
2018-09-30 02:11:21	+winny	oh yeah here we go: --vi-keys
2018-09-30 02:12:00	+winny	mobo: w-why
2018-09-30 02:12:19	+brooks	mobo likes to shittalk stallman
2018-09-30 02:12:22	+mobo	what need does it fulfill 
2018-09-30 02:12:26	+mobo	they're just manpages
2018-09-30 02:12:28	+winny	i do like to shittalk stallman too
2018-09-30 02:12:29	+mobo	with shitty keybinds
2018-09-30 02:12:40	+winny	mobo: info has a larger scope tho
2018-09-30 02:12:51	+mobo	they're manpages ffs
2018-09-30 02:13:04	+brooks	no they aren't
2018-09-30 02:13:05	+mobo	their scope is being able to read them in a book-like format
2018-09-30 02:13:23	+brooks	dysfigured: hey what do you think of greycat
2018-09-30 02:13:34	+winny	it has hierarchical structure, linking, and a far easier to write
2018-09-30 02:13:42	+brooks	^
2018-09-30 02:14:20	+mobo	bloat
2018-09-30 02:14:24	+winny	lol
2018-09-30 02:15:52	+brooks	need a GUI manpage viewer with linking and tabs
2018-09-30 02:15:59	+brooks	but not in electron and not a webpage
2018-09-30 02:16:23	+ym	manpages aren't that hard to write imo, and what benefits does a hierarchical structure has?
2018-09-30 02:16:33	+ym	i just use nvim for as manpage
2018-09-30 02:16:38	+ym	s/page/pager
2018-09-30 02:18:05	+brooks	have you used info?
2018-09-30 02:18:11	+brooks	it treats related topics like a book
2018-09-30 02:18:18	+brooks	you can go from page to page by scrolling
2018-09-30 02:18:33	+winny	ym: case and point bash(1) vs bash infopages
2018-09-30 02:18:35	+brooks	and by page to page I mean on different but related topics
2018-09-30 02:18:48	+mobo	bloat
2018-09-30 02:18:51	+winny	lol
2018-09-30 02:18:58	+brooks	at the very least, we're missing out on information in info by using only man
2018-09-30 02:19:20	+mobo	then put more info in manpages
2018-09-30 02:19:23	+isk	winny: https://my.mixtape.moe/tknyxo.png
2018-09-30 02:19:25	+isk	nice
2018-09-30 02:19:33	+winny	mobo: tutorials don't belong in manpages btw
2018-09-30 02:19:36	+winny	for example
2018-09-30 02:19:43	+winny	it's for technical documentation
2018-09-30 02:20:08	+brooks	who is going to do that
2018-09-30 02:20:10	+winny	i learned ed via gnu ed's tutorial
2018-09-30 02:20:14	+winny	in infopages
2018-09-30 02:20:15	+winny	:3
2018-09-30 02:20:17	+winny	i use ed a lot
2018-09-30 02:20:43	+brooks	people make the software and put the docs in info rather than man
2018-09-30 02:20:45	+brooks	now what
2018-09-30 02:20:56	+brooks	are we gonna waste time and energy moving it to man or just use info
2018-09-30 02:21:00	+brooks	smh
2018-09-30 02:21:09	+brooks	the level of trolling is too damn high
2018-09-30 02:21:42	+winny	lmao
2018-09-30 02:22:05	+brooks	it makes me feel disrespected
2018-09-30 02:22:07	+winny	at least we aren't stuck with docbook cuckery that freebsd ppl love
2018-09-30 02:22:39	+Nux	can you still get root on bsd before boot
2018-09-30 02:22:55	+brooks	I can get root on linux before boot
2018-09-30 02:23:09	+brooks	any1 know how I can foreach line of a file and run commands with it
2018-09-30 02:23:12	+Nux	all version
2018-09-30 02:23:13	+Nux	?
2018-09-30 02:23:18	+brooks	yeah
2018-09-30 02:23:35	+brooks	if you have physical access you've already won
2018-09-30 02:23:40	+Nux	true
2018-09-30 02:23:47	+Nux	unless the have password on boot loader
2018-09-30 02:23:49	+Nux	get rekt
2018-09-30 02:23:49	+brooks	I'll just supply my own kernel and initramfs and I'll mount your filesystems as root
2018-09-30 02:24:07	+brooks	I'm not sure what vuln you're talking about though
2018-09-30 02:24:23	+Nux	there used to be a way on bsd that you could boot into soemthing
2018-09-30 02:24:27	+Nux	and reset the password
2018-09-30 02:24:36	+brooks	I do that on linux all the time
2018-09-30 02:24:36	+LambdaComplex	brooks: GNU man can produce html if that's worth anything at all
2018-09-30 02:24:41	+LambdaComplex	idr if it makes hyperlinks though
2018-09-30 02:24:43	+LambdaComplex	probably not tbh
2018-09-30 02:24:46	+gnu	i am a man
2018-09-30 02:24:53	+Nux	prove it
2018-09-30 02:24:56	+brooks	idr whether it does, but I remember the html
2018-09-30 02:24:57	+winny	Nux: ootb on freebsd you don't need password to get root
2018-09-30 02:25:00	+LambdaComplex	something something mannish boy
2018-09-30 02:25:10	+Nux	winny: oh 
2018-09-30 02:25:19	+winny	u can set the local console to insecure
2018-09-30 02:25:26	+winny	so it will prompt for root on rescure
2018-09-30 02:25:27	+LambdaComplex	Nux: i know you can do that on junos at least
2018-09-30 02:25:29	+winny	rescue*
2018-09-30 02:25:30	+LambdaComplex	which is based on freebsd
2018-09-30 02:25:31	+brooks	Nux: boot a live iso and mount /dev/sd<X><N> /mnt/hdd
2018-09-30 02:25:44	+LambdaComplex	brooks: mfs luks
2018-09-30 02:25:46	+LambdaComplex	*mfw
2018-09-30 02:25:56	+brooks	I ain't saying you can't stop it
2018-09-30 02:25:59	+Nux	brooks: this why you password protect your bootloader
2018-09-30 02:26:00	+winny	but as brooks said without extra safeguards in place physical access is the only safety on most installations
2018-09-30 02:26:01	+brooks	I'm just saying that's how it works
2018-09-30 02:26:02	+Nux	and or encrypt your hdd
2018-09-30 02:26:06	+Nux	or both
2018-09-30 02:26:19	+brooks	I encrypt my hdd
2018-09-30 02:26:27	+winny	Nux: password protecting the boot loader is sort of a joke
2018-09-30 02:26:30	+Nux	i wish i would of encrypted this one
2018-09-30 02:26:33	+winny	just pull the hdd
2018-09-30 02:26:36	+brooks	I can flash a new bootloader
2018-09-30 02:26:38	+brooks	too
2018-09-30 02:26:45	+Nux	true
2018-09-30 02:26:51	+brooks	it's not that hard, even
2018-09-30 02:27:00	+Nux	then i guess just encrypt
2018-09-30 02:27:02	+brooks	it's kind of a pain but if you're persistent you can get the hang of it
2018-09-30 02:27:12	+Nux	persitent is the key to everything
2018-09-30 02:27:16	+winny	i encrypt everything basically
2018-09-30 02:27:17	+Nux	you will get into anything
2018-09-30 02:27:21	+Nux	if your persistent
2018-09-30 02:27:35	+Nux	hence APT Advanced Persistent Threat
2018-09-30 02:27:42	+brooks	I'm in the process of redoing security on all my stuff
2018-09-30 02:27:54	+brooks	it's really fun
2018-09-30 02:28:06	+Nux	brooks could i safely encrypt partitions on an already installed os
2018-09-30 02:28:23	+winny	the only server i use daily that isn't encrypted is my vps cuz i don't host it, so i can't really ensure it's secure in the same capacity of my workstation or laptop
2018-09-30 02:28:42	+brooks	realistically, probably not unless you have another storage medium to backup and restore from
2018-09-30 02:28:45	+brooks	and then wipe
2018-09-30 02:29:28	+winny	Nux: not really no, at the very least you'll have to (1) wipe your sensitive data that was in plaintext (2) boot up a livecd, copy+redo partitioning (3) create new encrypted volume (4) copy old data over (5) reconfigure boot loader
2018-09-30 02:29:48	+winny	easier to just backup and restore and let it be a lesson
2018-09-30 02:29:57	+gnu	don't neglect to feed your pets
2018-09-30 02:30:03	+winny	^
2018-09-30 02:30:07	+brooks	put in new hdd, encrypt it, copy over data, wipe old drive
2018-09-30 02:30:14	+Nux	tfw its been 4 years since ive installed arch
2018-09-30 02:30:19	+Nux	how much has changed
2018-09-30 02:30:21	+Nux	lol
2018-09-30 02:30:26	+winny	Nux: it's just manual now
2018-09-30 02:30:27	+gnu	i might go to arch again in the future
2018-09-30 02:30:27	+brooks	a lot, it's gotten easier
2018-09-30 02:30:33	+Nux	mfw
2018-09-30 02:30:40	+Nux	thats gay then
2018-09-30 02:30:44	+Nux	i need to feel superior
2018-09-30 02:30:54	+brooks	arch is like
2018-09-30 02:30:56	+winny	it's pretty easy, u just type in a few commands after formatting/mounting stuff like you should
2018-09-30 02:30:58	+brooks	first step to going hard
2018-09-30 02:31:08	+winny	tbh im forever turned off arch
2018-09-30 02:31:16	+winny	terrible distro and terrible community
2018-09-30 02:31:18	+Nux	ya i wanna switch
2018-09-30 02:31:20	+winny	only good part is the wiki
2018-09-30 02:31:32	+Nux	the wiki is bae and gay at the sametime
2018-09-30 02:31:39	+Nux	they dont explain enough on somethings
2018-09-30 02:31:44	+winny	been using gentoo but idk if i'd recommend it
2018-09-30 02:31:47	+LambdaComplex	hey mobo can i hear some of your geetar playing
2018-09-30 02:31:55	+Nux	its like you can do X , Y or Z way
2018-09-30 02:31:57	-->	ym_ (~ym@C0861A5E.4F9F2B8F.34C78F8B.IP) has joined #code
2018-09-30 02:31:59	+winny	it works great for my uses but my uses are pretty simple
2018-09-30 02:32:03	+Nux	then not explain how to do Y or Z
2018-09-30 02:32:10	+brooks	the wiki MAKES ME MAD
2018-09-30 02:32:18	+winny	ooo tell us brooks i wanna kno
2018-09-30 02:32:18	+Nux	because of what i just said?
2018-09-30 02:32:19	+brooks	it used to actually be useful, now it's just a massive wealth of information
2018-09-30 02:32:35	+brooks	you have to navigate all over the damned thing to find pertinent information
2018-09-30 02:32:40	+winny	yeah true it's often a repeat of most other available documentation
2018-09-30 02:32:45	+Nux	yes brooks
2018-09-30 02:32:47	+winny	so it's hard to weed through the distro specific things
2018-09-30 02:32:48	+brooks	it used to be like
2018-09-30 02:32:51	+Nux	thats why i said bae and gay
2018-09-30 02:32:56	+LambdaComplex	https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Main_Page
2018-09-30 02:32:59	+LambdaComplex	i've found some good shit on this
2018-09-30 02:32:59	+brooks	if you go through the install guide, it'd tell you what to need to know, and link out to additional info
2018-09-30 02:33:21	+winny	tbh i'd recommend debian or ubuntu (well, not the default desktop install though) these days
2018-09-30 02:33:23	+brooks	but now it's just all the additional info, and the installation process minimizes the need to know any of it unless, you know, you're the kind of user who does need to know
2018-09-30 02:33:26	+brooks	so it just makes shit harder
2018-09-30 02:33:31	+LambdaComplex	e.g. https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/SSD_Over-provisioning_using_hdparm
2018-09-30 02:33:36	+Nux	i was considering debian tbh
2018-09-30 02:33:37	<--	ym (~ym@DC3ABE49.7CAF545E.34C78F8B.IP) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2018-09-30 02:33:42	+Nux	cause i use it on all my vps's
2018-09-30 02:33:45	+Nux	and i like it
2018-09-30 02:33:48	+brooks	I don't want to use systemd
2018-09-30 02:33:49	+winny	Nux: when u need firefox, just use the snap
2018-09-30 02:33:52	+brooks	debian used to be my goto
2018-09-30 02:33:56	+winny	on debian*
2018-09-30 02:34:04	+Nux	snap?
2018-09-30 02:34:15	+brooks	it's a package manager for a lot of external stuff
2018-09-30 02:34:16	+winny	otherwise u are stuck with ESR or some other package pinning fuckery
2018-09-30 02:34:27	+Nux	ya esr is gay
2018-09-30 02:34:30	+winny	snap is pretty great
2018-09-30 02:34:32	+winny	also docker
2018-09-30 02:34:43	+brooks	ESR is what they use for tor browser
2018-09-30 02:34:44	+winny	literally cut down on half of my weird software installations
2018-09-30 02:34:44	+Nux	the thing i dont like on deb
2018-09-30 02:34:53	+Nux	is you cant change SELinux from permissive
2018-09-30 02:34:55	+Nux	or it will brick it
2018-09-30 02:34:56	+brooks	is snap secure and safe?
2018-09-30 02:35:20	+winny	brooks: idk i'd only assume it's as safe as running the software normally, with another third party to trust
2018-09-30 02:35:24	+mobo	hold on LambdaComplex 
2018-09-30 02:35:43	+brooks	that's exactly what I don't want on linux
2018-09-30 02:35:45	+winny	just like docker snap isn't supposed to be a security layer
2018-09-30 02:35:51	+LambdaComplex	mobo: ok
2018-09-30 02:36:00	+winny	it's just a deployment tool
2018-09-30 02:36:08	+Nux	why isnt selinux in arch repos
2018-09-30 02:36:19	+winny	selinux is a pain
2018-09-30 02:36:22	+winny	why would u want it
2018-09-30 02:36:23	+Nux	not really
2018-09-30 02:36:26	+mobo	what should I play
2018-09-30 02:36:27	+Nux	cause i know how to use it
2018-09-30 02:36:27	 *	Cosumu pets brooks
2018-09-30 02:36:31	+gnu	it's an nsa backdoor
2018-09-30 02:36:34	+Nux	no it isnt
2018-09-30 02:36:36	+Nux	omfg
2018-09-30 02:36:38	+gnu	look
2018-09-30 02:36:40	+Nux	the nsa does not care
2018-09-30 02:36:40	+gnu	i read reddit
2018-09-30 02:36:41	+Nux	ffs
2018-09-30 02:36:43	+LambdaComplex	Nux: because making selinux work requires maintaining selinux policies
2018-09-30 02:36:45	+LambdaComplex	or w/e they're called
2018-09-30 02:36:47	+mobo	LambdaComplex what should I play
2018-09-30 02:36:47	+gnu	i go on reddit
2018-09-30 02:36:49	+winny	Nux: how often have you had to put it in audit mode and modify your policy
2018-09-30 02:36:50	+Nux	LambdaComplex: and?
2018-09-30 02:36:52	+LambdaComplex	the arch devs do not have time for that shit
2018-09-30 02:36:57	+LambdaComplex	or at least they don't care enough
2018-09-30 02:37:00	+Nux	ive been using it for months on my main vps
2018-09-30 02:37:02	+Nux	no issues
2018-09-30 02:37:09	+LambdaComplex	mobo: hm.....in my time of dying?
2018-09-30 02:37:16	+mobo	never heard of it tbh
2018-09-30 02:37:18	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-09-30 02:37:21	+mobo	I can play uh
2018-09-30 02:37:21	+LambdaComplex	also maybe not bluesy enough
2018-09-30 02:37:23	+LambdaComplex	hmmmmm
2018-09-30 02:37:23	+mobo	john fahey
2018-09-30 02:37:24	+mobo	yeah
2018-09-30 02:37:27	+LambdaComplex	but
2018-09-30 02:37:30	+LambdaComplex	i wanna suggest something
2018-09-30 02:37:32	+LambdaComplex	!!!
2018-09-30 02:37:33	+mobo	go ahead
2018-09-30 02:37:38	+Nux	winny: ive never had to
2018-09-30 02:37:41	+mobo	I'm too drunk to learn anything new though
2018-09-30 02:37:44	+LambdaComplex	lemme think
2018-09-30 02:37:46	+LambdaComplex	uhhhh
2018-09-30 02:37:59	+LambdaComplex	mobo: does it have to be open tuning
2018-09-30 02:38:10	+mobo	preferrably 
2018-09-30 02:38:13	+LambdaComplex	hm
2018-09-30 02:38:16	+LambdaComplex	when the levee breaks?
2018-09-30 02:38:17	+winny	Nux: there's a lot of weird software that breaks with selinux unless you find policy settings from an existing package or install it via your package manager (go figure)
2018-09-30 02:38:22	+mobo	nah, not familiar
2018-09-30 02:38:30	+mobo	I have a few old recordings I can post
2018-09-30 02:38:37	+mobo	https://clyp.it/h0ll4czp
2018-09-30 02:38:39	+Nux	winny: yes ive had to install policys for shit
2018-09-30 02:38:41	+mobo	that was one of my faves
2018-09-30 02:38:42	+Nux	that isnt that hard
2018-09-30 02:38:43	+LambdaComplex	nobody's fault but mine????
2018-09-30 02:38:43	+brooks	how do I get tmux to actually reset when I run reset
2018-09-30 02:38:44	+Nux	or a big deal
2018-09-30 02:38:58	+mobo	nah
2018-09-30 02:39:21	+LambdaComplex	mobo: is this two guitars
2018-09-30 02:39:23	+mobo	yup
2018-09-30 02:39:28	+mobo	I recorded over myself
2018-09-30 02:39:31	+mobo	same thing both times
2018-09-30 02:39:31	+LambdaComplex	nice
2018-09-30 02:39:42	+mobo	john cale does the same thing with his singing
2018-09-30 02:39:46	+mobo	decided to try it out
2018-09-30 02:39:53	+mobo	the ending to that song is my favorite
2018-09-30 02:39:55	+winny	Nux: eh it's needless effort, i don't really understand the usecase of selinux, since if you're running untrusted software it won't really give you enough piece of mind anyway

2018-09-30 03:12:12	+brooks	I want a way to generate a kind of visual diff in the form of "here are the menus and sub menus to alter and the symbols that correspond to them"
2018-09-30 03:14:24	+winny	trial by fire is rewarding
2018-09-30 03:15:54	+brooks	it's tru
2018-09-30 03:18:07	+LambdaComplex	mobo was too drunk to shitpost severely
2018-09-30 03:18:10	+LambdaComplex	it was great
2018-09-30 03:18:56	+winny	brooks: have u used any other distros as involved as void?
2018-09-30 03:19:10	+brooks	I installed gentoo a couple times
2018-09-30 03:19:28	+brooks	I needed void to generalize what I remembered for some reason
2018-09-30 03:19:39	+mobo	I'm not drunk at all
2018-09-30 03:19:43	+brooks	it seems a lot easier now
2018-09-30 03:19:47	+brooks	damn
2018-09-30 03:19:51	+mobo	I'm way more sober than I usually am at 9:20
2018-09-30 03:19:52	+brooks	I still want to be drunk tho
2018-09-30 03:19:53	+mobo	and I hate it
2018-09-30 03:19:59	+brooks	yikes
2018-09-30 03:20:01	+brooks	I'm tryna avoid that
2018-09-30 03:20:09	+mobo	yeah alcoholism sucks
2018-09-30 03:20:10	+brooks	I don't trust myself with alcohol at all
2018-09-30 03:20:45	+mobo	it's better to avoid it completely than to get into a love affair with it
2018-09-30 03:21:01	+mobo	but w/e
2018-09-30 03:21:37	+brooks	I'm considering it
2018-09-30 03:21:51	+brooks	I should probably see about something for anxiety
2018-09-30 03:22:11	+mobo	I took zoloft for anxiety, until I discovered alcohol works better
2018-09-30 03:22:29	+mobo	zoloft can be good, if you're considering an SSRI look into that
2018-09-30 03:22:39	+brooks	I'm hoping for weaker benzos
2018-09-30 03:23:07	+mobo	I don't trust benzos honestly, addiction to them is worse than alcoholism 
2018-09-30 03:23:18	+mobo	they'll lose effectiveness as you gain tolerance
2018-09-30 03:23:21	+brooks	that's why I want weaker ones, something for acute anxiety
2018-09-30 03:23:24	+mobo	yeah
2018-09-30 03:23:30	+mobo	would you take them every day?
2018-09-30 03:23:33	+brooks	nah
2018-09-30 03:23:38	+Cosumu	!
2018-09-30 03:23:39	+brooks	couple times a week, I hope
2018-09-30 03:23:40	+mobo	then you should be fine
2018-09-30 03:23:56	+brooks	sometimes I have bad months and shit
2018-09-30 03:23:57	+mobo	I was to the point where I couldn't function in the evenings
2018-09-30 03:24:00	+mobo	yeah
2018-09-30 03:24:10	+brooks	but usually it's more like a few bad days
2018-09-30 03:24:27	+mobo	then benzos should be good if it's a periodic thing
2018-09-30 03:24:32	+mobo	just don't take them every day
2018-09-30 03:24:42	+brooks	I've had a bad few weeks this month and I've been drunk on maybe 1/3 of the nights so far
2018-09-30 03:25:01	+mobo	don't feel bad about that, I've been drunk every night this year
2018-09-30 03:25:12	+brooks	I don't feel bad, but I do think it's kinda worrying
2018-09-30 03:25:16	+brooks	could be how it starts
2018-09-30 03:25:18	+mobo	yeah, I feel ya
2018-09-30 03:25:28	+mobo	that's definitely what happened with me
2018-09-30 03:25:49	+brooks	it seemed a lot harder when I first started drinking
2018-09-30 03:25:51	+mobo	although I've seen people slip into benzo addiction faster
2018-09-30 03:25:56	+mobo	just be careful
2018-09-30 03:26:35	+brooks	that's fair
2018-09-30 03:26:41	+brooks	thanks
2018-09-30 03:26:53	+mobo	yeah
2018-09-30 03:27:06	+mobo	like alcohol ain't great for you, but benzos can really mess ya up if you abuse them
2018-09-30 03:27:18	+mobo	I prefer to stay away from them when treating anxiety 
2018-09-30 03:27:30	+mobo	just make sure you don't take more than what you're prescribed
2018-09-30 03:27:43	+brooks	I'm hoping whatever I have won't induce enough euphoria to be addictive, but it might turn out I'm more anxious than I realize
2018-09-30 03:27:47	+brooks	that'd be...not too surprising
2018-09-30 03:28:06	+brooks	such that "no anxiety right now" might be lower than my baseline or something
2018-09-30 03:28:15	+mobo	yeah, I feel that
2018-09-30 03:28:31	+mobo	if you're taking it to treat random pop up symptoms it's okay
2018-09-30 03:28:42	+mobo	but IMO taking benzos to treat 24/7 anxiety is bad
2018-09-30 03:29:26	+brooks	yeah, that I agree with
2018-09-30 03:29:32	+brooks	for sure
2018-09-30 03:30:57	+mobo	aight, going to sleep, night all

2018-09-30 03:34:32	+winny	brooks: weed can help with anxiety in smaller doses (it gets the opposite effect if you make it a multiple-times a day thing)
2018-09-30 03:34:52	+brooks	oh yeah
2018-09-30 03:35:12	+winny	i think weed had made me a better person but been dry for awhile
2018-09-30 03:35:21	+winny	also weed culture is weird
2018-09-30 03:35:36	+winny	idk how to properly dose it if the quality in so inconsistent

2018-09-30 03:36:35	+winny	last week i got drunk most nights

2018-09-30 20:40:54	--	narrator is now known as eti
2018-09-30 20:42:20	+dysfigured	promises are like futures, they're like these weird opaque "container" types things, and async/await lets you "extract" values from these containers
2018-09-30 20:42:24	+darkwater	it's barely different even
2018-09-30 20:42:41	+darkwater	you always put async in the function signature and await in front of the thing
2018-09-30 20:42:54	+darkwater	also there's an important difference between promises and futures
2018-09-30 20:43:00	+dysfigured	in haskell it's do in the signature and <- in front of the thing
2018-09-30 20:43:21	+dysfigured	in go i don't think you even need a thing in the signature
2018-09-30 20:43:25	+darkwater	promises are executed when they are made, futures don't run until you make them run
2018-09-30 20:43:45	+darkwater	go just launches goroutines, not really futures or similar
2018-09-30 20:43:49	+darkwater	just green threads
2018-09-30 20:45:46	+dysfigured	*hand waving* implementation details
2018-09-30 20:46:25	+darkwater	nah i think green threads are different from async/await stuff
2018-09-30 20:46:44	+darkwater	with await you suspend the function until you get the value you want
2018-09-30 20:46:50	+darkwater	with go you just spawn a green thread
2018-09-30 20:47:00	+darkwater	they work completely different
2018-09-30 20:48:20	+dysfigured	well sure, underneath the hood, languages all do things differently
2018-09-30 20:49:37	+dysfigured	implementation details aside, async-await, do-notation, go-routines, et al are all similar abstractions over the same problem
2018-09-30 20:54:06	+darkwater	i disagree
2018-09-30 20:54:50	+darkwater	async/await makes async code looks sync, go-routines is literally just spawning green threads
2018-09-30 20:57:01	+dysfigured	you don't think <- is similar to await ?
2018-09-30 20:57:45	+dysfigured	and similar <- or >>=
2018-09-30 20:59:16	+dysfigured	(await from js, and <- and >>= from haskell)

2018-10-01 00:52:40	+isk	plz help

2018-10-01 00:53:01	+brooks	if I were to guess I'd say the i is for interface
2018-10-01 00:53:09	+brooks	oorrr identifier
2018-10-01 00:53:17	+isk	well
2018-10-01 00:53:32	+isk	bluedevil-sendfile -h shows -k for bluetooth address or -u for UBI
2018-10-01 00:53:41	+isk	I tried -k with the mac address

2018-10-01 00:53:50	+isk	it has bluetooth://address listed so I tried that too

2018-10-01 00:55:37	+brooks	obviously this isn't a solution to your problem though
2018-10-01 00:55:38	+isk	otherwise I'd just ssh

2018-10-01 00:55:47	+brooks	looking for docs 
2018-10-01 00:55:59	+isk	yeah obscure kde shit is hard to find docs for
2018-10-01 00:56:09	+isk	for example, yakuake for some reason has its own config for the konsole instances it runs
2018-10-01 00:56:20	+isk	so if I config pure konsole it doens't carry over
2018-10-01 00:56:30	+isk	and it says literally no where where yakuake stores its own konsole config
2018-10-01 00:56:31	+isk	:''''''^)

2018-10-01 00:59:44	+brooks	^f bluedevil and check out that table
2018-10-01 01:02:07	+brooks	does this comment mean anything to you? // Returns "hciX" part from UBI "/org/bluez/hciX/dev_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx"
2018-10-01 01:03:15	+isk	well
2018-10-01 01:03:17	+isk	no
2018-10-01 01:03:31	+isk	looks like you could fit a MAC in the x's
2018-10-01 01:04:05	+brooks	you'd think 
2018-10-01 01:04:39	+brooks	maybe you can search github for uses of bluedevil-sendfile
2018-10-01 01:09:52	+isk	nice

2018-10-01 01:12:29	+isk	I'm not sure what the last part is
2018-10-01 01:12:47	+isk	otherwise I did try bluetooth://MAC, quoted and not
2018-10-01 01:23:38	+brooks	nice
2018-10-01 01:27:42	+isk	brooks: any suggestions for a cli tool to convert images to ansi art

2018-10-01 05:13:33	+isk	I'm trying to come up with a name for the script that manages turning on/off "smart" devices to control my gecko's habitat
2018-10-01 05:13:46	+isk	I got "tropicomancer"
2018-10-01 05:14:04	+isk	also considered "terraform"
2018-10-01 05:14:44	+isk	also as a fun fact I discoverd while looking up various root words, the word for looking for shapes in the clouds is nepholococcygia
2018-10-01 05:32:37	+brooks	I decided to look up etymology stuff cuz of this this and happened across this article: https://www.etymonline.com/columns/post/acronymphomania
2018-10-01 05:42:43	+winny	isk: geckoctl
2018-10-01 05:43:08	+isk	the whole system which controls his habitat, logs stats, and takes timelapse is geckOS
2018-10-01 05:43:36	+isk	the thing responsible for collecting biometrics and managing the climate is mother-terrarium
2018-10-01 05:43:40	+winny	geckobutler

2018-10-01 05:44:36	+winny	call it geckomon
2018-10-01 05:44:52	+winny	call it gay gecko friend
2018-10-01 05:45:05	+isk	well if anything the geckOS submodules would be geckos-*
2018-10-01 05:45:32	+isk	so the original name for the climate-control module was geckos-tempest
2018-10-01 05:45:57	+isk	think I'm leaning towards atmomancer
2018-10-01 05:46:11	+brooks	that one is good
2018-10-01 05:46:13	+brooks	I like that one
2018-10-01 05:46:17	+isk	yeah
2018-10-01 05:46:28	+isk	considered thermovapor and thermonepholus

2018-10-01 12:15:02	+Kirjava	I dunno yet it was mostly many fuzzy cuddling. she has a wicked articuno tattoo on the side of the body tho
2018-10-01 12:15:57	+LambdaComplex	>fuzzy cuddling
2018-10-01 12:16:01	+LambdaComplex	does this mean you were wearing fursuits
2018-10-01 12:16:09	+Kirjava	ok that came off wrong
2018-10-01 12:16:15	+Kirjava	MDMA + cuddling = nom
2018-10-01 12:16:36	+Kirjava	tho I guess she is a furry ~_~

2018-10-01 12:18:36	+Kirjava	which can get. very. cringe.
2018-10-01 12:20:48	+Kirjava	but it's okay the really lame people left when we went to get drugs and didn't say bye I think maybe they were scared

2018-10-01 12:27:22	+Kirjava	well this is outside my jurisdiction then
2018-10-01 12:27:26	+Kirjava	unknown terratory
2018-10-01 12:27:38	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-10-01 12:27:44	+LambdaComplex	is alcohol a suitable replacement?
2018-10-01 12:27:46	+LambdaComplex	i think it is
2018-10-01 12:27:49	+Kirjava	*territory
2018-10-01 12:27:52	+Kirjava	lmao uh
2018-10-01 12:27:53	 *	LambdaComplex needs a 48 pack of beer
2018-10-01 12:28:03	 *	LambdaComplex might need to visit the liquor store too
2018-10-01 12:28:04	+Kirjava	maybe it will seem like it is
2018-10-01 12:28:08	+Kirjava	and that might be good enough?!
2018-10-01 12:28:08	+LambdaComplex	or i could just bring some brandy
2018-10-01 12:28:14	+Kirjava	are you going on your own
2018-10-01 12:28:42	+LambdaComplex	nah, i'll be camping with a friend and possibly her boyfriend if he actually shows up
2018-10-01 12:28:52	+LambdaComplex	and we'll be at a campsite with a bunch of other people
2018-10-01 12:29:02	+Kirjava	ah sweet
2018-10-01 12:29:14	+Kirjava	tbh I don't really "got game" particularly
2018-10-01 12:29:52	+Kirjava	I have a friend that used to treat it like so and do shit like
2018-10-01 12:30:04	+Kirjava	he'd go over to someone and tell an intentionally bad joke
2018-10-01 12:30:19	+LambdaComplex	a-and then what
2018-10-01 12:30:20	+Kirjava	repeat al coda
2018-10-01 12:30:36	+LambdaComplex	sorry, i can't read sheet music
2018-10-01 12:30:37	+Kirjava	eventually it ends up working I guess?
2018-10-01 12:30:43	+LambdaComplex	oh
2018-10-01 12:30:53	+LambdaComplex	like how if i go through 1000 dicks on omegle eventually i'll find a cute girl?
2018-10-01 12:31:02	+Kirjava	exactly
2018-10-01 12:31:07	+Kirjava	this isn't my advice though
2018-10-01 12:31:37	 *	LambdaComplex will wear a fedora and neg the whole time :^)
2018-10-01 12:31:46	+Kirjava	jfc
2018-10-01 12:32:04	+Kirjava	yeah ok that shit might end up working - but you'll end up with someone that you're probably not that into
2018-10-01 12:32:32	+Kirjava	actually it depends do you want to meet nice girls or do you just want sum fuk
2018-10-01 12:32:35	+LambdaComplex	i was kidding!!
2018-10-01 12:32:45	+LambdaComplex	mfw Kirjava ignored the ":^)"
2018-10-01 12:33:05	+Kirjava	maybe sometimes I realise people are joking but still reply seriously
2018-10-01 12:33:42	+Kirjava	it's like how sometimes I say something that I know isn't the right thing but it came to my head like I'm thinking aloud or something
2018-10-01 12:34:01	+Kirjava	I mean come on a fedora
2018-10-01 12:34:07	+Kirjava	if you were serious we have bigger problems
2018-10-01 12:38:06	+Kirjava	LambdaComplex: so lets do an experiment
2018-10-01 12:38:26	+Kirjava	LambdaComplex: hypothesis: "alcohol is a valid substitute for charisma"
2018-10-01 12:44:35	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: aren't hypotheses supposed to be testable?
2018-10-01 12:45:01	+Kirjava	yeah I didn't say this was going to be scientific
2018-10-01 12:45:09	+Kirjava	the plan is to get you loaded and talking to girls
2018-10-01 12:48:51	+Kirjava	also how is that not testable
2018-10-01 12:58:54	+LambdaComplex	well, maybe it is
2018-10-01 12:59:00	+LambdaComplex	but we'd need a concrete way to test charisma
2018-10-01 12:59:12	+LambdaComplex	also, controlling the experiment so as to only be modifying one variable would be pretty difficult

2018-10-01 13:01:19	+Kirjava	LambdaComplex: testing charmisa is easy
2018-10-01 13:01:51	+Kirjava	the metric is simply 'number of amicable conversations with girls'
2018-10-01 13:05:55	+LambdaComplex	hmm
2018-10-01 13:06:08	+LambdaComplex	c-can we do this at rocky horror instead?
2018-10-01 13:06:17	+LambdaComplex	i can just walk up to girls and say "hey you're hot" there and it's not weird
2018-10-01 13:06:42	+Kirjava	why would it be weird elsewhere
2018-10-01 13:07:08	+Kirjava	oh god you don't shout it while eating a bag of chetos do you?
2018-10-01 13:07:10	+Kirjava	*cheetos
2018-10-01 13:07:19	+Kirjava	"HAY. YOUR HOT"
2018-10-01 13:07:30	+Kirjava	like, shouted from the other side of wherever you are
2018-10-01 13:07:46	+Kirjava	that is not charisma :P
2018-10-01 13:12:35	+LambdaComplex	n-no
2018-10-01 13:16:03	+LambdaComplex	Kirjava: would you walk up to a girl in public and tell her she has a nice butt
2018-10-01 13:19:49	+Kirjava	probably not :S

2018-10-01 13:29:22	+LambdaComplex	you can do that at rocky horror and it's not even weird

2018-10-01 14:56:13	+brooks	russian doesn't have a y as a consonant I think
2018-10-01 14:56:34	+brooks	and transliterating to j is usually from uhhh
2018-10-01 14:56:37	+brooks	what's that one fucking letter

2018-10-01 14:58:03	+kori	brooks: zh?
2018-10-01 14:58:32	+brooks	yeah zh is another common representation
2018-10-01 14:59:05	+kori	but its not really zh and its not really j
2018-10-01 14:59:07	+brooks	Nux: it's commonly considered to mean bitch in english but I'm not sure it's actually got any of the same connotations as english's "bitch"
2018-10-01 14:59:07	+kori	its like, in the middle
2018-10-01 14:59:50	+Nux	so its it gun but son of a gun
2018-10-01 15:00:22	+Nux	would that be a good analogy
2018-10-01 15:00:29	+brooks	>From Old East Slavic сꙋка (suka), from Proto-Slavic *sǫka (compare Polish suka), ultimately from a derivative of Proto-Indo-European *ḱwṓ.

2018-10-01 15:00:33	+brooks	huh
2018-10-01 15:00:49	+brooks	so I guess it actually is 'bitch'
2018-10-01 15:00:49	+Nux	so actual dogs
2018-10-01 15:00:50	+brooks	neat
2018-10-01 15:00:53	+Nux	hmm
2018-10-01 15:01:02	+brooks	it's not necessarily feminine though
2018-10-01 15:01:05	+brooks	or emasculating
2018-10-01 15:01:13	+brooks	it's more like dog, but considered vulgar
2018-10-01 15:01:17	+Nux	are .7z's usually slow on extracting

2018-10-01 23:19:38	+Arathnim	No xorg console, no ssh
2018-10-01 23:23:28	+winny	Arathnim: u should boot into single user mode / rescue mode and view the logs from there
2018-10-01 23:24:13	+Arathnim	Yeah
2018-10-01 23:24:32	+winny	ssh is oddly nice for dealing with weird display problems

2018-10-01 23:28:29	+Arathnim	This is a problem
2018-10-01 23:28:59	+winny	Arathnim: what messages?
2018-10-01 23:29:16	+Arathnim	The root shell kills itself after about two minutes, so it's hard to see.
2018-10-01 23:29:47	+winny	so you could temporarily disable your display manager
2018-10-01 23:29:50	+winny	then reboot as normal
2018-10-01 23:30:04	+winny	that way you don't start xorg
2018-10-01 23:30:38	+winny	might be as simple as systemctl disable lightdm
2018-10-01 23:30:40	+winny	or gdm
2018-10-01 23:30:52	+winny	from the recovery shell
2018-10-01 23:31:17	+winny	that way u can (1) find the errors and try to fix without it killing itself (2) revert the nvidia drivers
2018-10-01 23:31:27	+Arathnim	Huh. The network manager is killing the shell.
2018-10-01 23:31:34	+winny	o.o
2018-10-01 23:32:36	+Arathnim	Oh, and it does something to the keyboard drivers, too.
2018-10-01 23:32:54	+winny	wrong keyboard layout?
2018-10-01 23:33:15	+Arathnim	Dunno, but taking it out and plugging it back in works.

2018-10-02 12:18:10	+Kirjava	he couldnt do it because it was in cm
2018-10-02 12:18:15	+Kirjava	my solution was to
2018-10-02 12:18:18	+Kirjava	convert cm to px
2018-10-02 12:18:22	+Kirjava	then subtract one
2018-10-02 12:18:26	+Kirjava	it worked!

2018-10-02 12:41:24	+bdelloid	you wanted to show me your desktop?
2018-10-02 12:41:25	+Kirjava	I just wanted to know if I needed to have a computer in front of me to go through stuff
2018-10-02 12:41:31	+Kirjava	not to share it

2018-10-02 12:42:04	+bdelloid	oh

2018-10-02 12:42:06	+bdelloid	cheeky
2018-10-02 12:42:23	+Kirjava	ideally I would do it a little later while at home if that was possible

2018-10-02 13:19:08	+brooks	and that's...always risky 
2018-10-02 13:19:16	+Kirjava	why do you wanna read it
2018-10-02 13:19:27	+brooks	you should always read five other books to see where the first one went wrong
2018-10-02 13:19:39	+brooks	well
2018-10-02 13:19:44	+brooks	check out the table of contents 
2018-10-02 13:20:20	+Kirjava	"how2linux"
2018-10-02 13:21:50	+brooks	I’ve grouped the chapters of this book into the following parts:
2018-10-02 13:21:51	+brooks	1.Background and concepts: history of UNIX, C, and Linux and overview of UNIX standards (Chapter 1); a programmer-oriented introduction to Linux and UNIX concepts (Chapter 2); and fundamental concepts for system programming on Linux and UNIX (Chapter 3).
2018-10-02 13:21:53	+brooks	2.Fundamental features of the system programming interface: file I/O (Chapter 4 and Chapter 5); processes (Chapter 6); memory allocation (Chapter 7); users and groups (Chapter 8); process credentials (Chapter 9); time (Chapter 10); system limits and options (Chapter 11); and retrieving system and process information (Chapter 12).
2018-10-02 13:21:55	+brooks	3.More advanced features of the system programming interface: file I/O buffering (Chapter 13); file systems (Chapter 14); file attributes (Chapter 15); extended attributes (Chapter 16); access control lists (Chapter 17); directories and links (Chapter 18); monitoring file events (Chapter 19); signals (Chapter 20 to Chapter 22); and timers (Chapter 23).
2018-10-02 13:21:57	+brooks	4.Processes, programs, and threads: process creation, process termination, monitoring child processes, and executing programs (Chapter 24 to Chapter 28); and POSIX threads (Chapter 29 to Chapter 33.
2018-10-02 13:22:35	+brooks	at a glance, it seems like a good way to gain a lot of new familiarity quickly 
2018-10-02 13:23:21	+Kirjava	"quickly"
2018-10-02 13:23:51	+brooks	more quickly than trying to figure out these things individually/on my own

2018-10-02 13:28:31	+Kirjava	you're gonna have to make a judgement call if no one else chimes in
2018-10-02 13:28:40	+Kirjava	I say you go for it tho, it looks highly informative
2018-10-02 13:28:50	+brooks	yeah
2018-10-02 13:28:55	+brooks	>At this time, AT&T held a government-sanctioned monopoly on the US telephone system. The terms of AT&T’s agreement with the US government prevented it from selling software, which meant that it could not sell UNIX as a product. Instead, beginning in 1974 with Fifth Edition, and especially with Sixth Edition, AT&T licensed UNIX for use in universities for a nominal distribution fee. The
2018-10-02 13:28:57	+brooks	university distributions included documentation and the kernel source code (about 10,000 lines at the time).
2018-10-02 13:29:48	+brooks	this is uh
2018-10-02 13:29:52	+brooks	illuminating
2018-10-02 13:30:11	+Kirjava	why
2018-10-02 13:30:19	+brooks	and your regular irregular reminder that meritocracy is fake
2018-10-02 13:31:06	+brooks	unix didn't win because it was better, it won because of economics and circumstance 
2018-10-02 13:31:12	+Kirjava	there is nothing wrong with judging people based on merit
2018-10-02 13:31:22	+brooks	no of course not
2018-10-02 13:31:29	+Kirjava	the sky is blue
2018-10-02 13:31:53	+Kirjava	ugggh
2018-10-02 13:32:01	+brooks	there's just something wrong with the idea that merit is the only determining factor in success and failure within some particular niche
2018-10-02 13:32:05	+Kirjava	the british tabloids are cheering for the end of freedom of movement
2018-10-02 13:32:08	+Kirjava	fucks sake this country
2018-10-02 13:32:27	+Kirjava	brooks: what other metrics are important
2018-10-02 13:33:11	+brooks	let me flip it around: "if you fail in this niche we consider a meritocracy, you didn't have the merit"
2018-10-02 13:33:16	+brooks	this is false
2018-10-02 13:34:00	+brooks	so you have to look at factors that contribute to success and failure outside merit in order to figure out how to reduce failure
2018-10-02 13:34:05	+Kirjava	then it's not a meritocracy then
2018-10-02 13:34:14	+brooks	correct, there's no such thing

2018-10-02 13:43:31	+brooks	the people who have the most success in, say, 'open source', tend to be people who have free time on top of their job, fit more easily into communities that are adjacent to the type of work being done, tend to understand the language being used in books and blog posts and articles on the subject
2018-10-02 13:43:44	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: it sucks that most places don't have blue cheese :(
2018-10-02 13:43:49	+brooks	anyone who falls short in any one of these factors will spend a *lot* of time playing catch-up
2018-10-02 13:44:01	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, one time I got grated parmesan cheese at whole foods
2018-10-02 13:44:06	+bdelloid	and it tasted and smelled like blue cheese
2018-10-02 13:44:11	+LambdaComplex	uhhh
2018-10-02 13:44:14	+LambdaComplex	that's a little worrying tbh
2018-10-02 13:44:19	+bdelloid	because they probably grated the blue cheese and didn't clean the grater
2018-10-02 13:44:24	+LambdaComplex	>grating
2018-10-02 13:44:26	+Kirjava	brooks: yeah that sounds right - I was just imagining it in a work environment where all else is equal
2018-10-02 13:44:26	+LambdaComplex	>blue cheese
2018-10-02 13:44:27	+brooks	the most successful programmers aren't people who only program at work, so the time and resources in the work environment aren't a good metric
2018-10-02 13:44:31	+LambdaComplex	shouldn't that just crumble
2018-10-02 13:44:31	+brooks	oh, nah
2018-10-02 13:44:34	+brooks	it's never like that
2018-10-02 13:44:38	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, crumble, grate
2018-10-02 13:44:48	+bdelloid	it's not born crumbled you know
2018-10-02 13:44:50	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: i wouldn't expect a grater to be necessary for blue cheese
2018-10-02 13:44:53	+LambdaComplex	it's insanely soft
2018-10-02 13:45:00	+LambdaComplex	parmesan is really hard and a grater is definitely needed
2018-10-02 13:45:01	+bdelloid	there are different kinds of blue cheese

2018-10-02 13:45:29	+brooks	the people who succeed in the work environments we regard as meritocratic are always people who spend about as much time programming outside work as inside

2018-10-02 13:45:56	+LambdaComplex	....wisconsin?
2018-10-02 13:46:02	+brooks	and if you don't fit into the culture of non-work programming communities, you can spend years trying to learn things that other people learn through osmosis
2018-10-02 13:46:08	+LambdaComplex	friendly reminder that mozarella is super ez to make at home
2018-10-02 13:46:23	+bdelloid	friendly reminder that you can make cheese with your dick
2018-10-02 13:46:27	+Kirjava	brooks: but some people learn better without osmosis
2018-10-02 13:46:46	+bdelloid	brooks, I've never gotten help through communities
2018-10-02 13:46:49	+brooks	is that a majority? does it back up meritocracy?
2018-10-02 13:46:52	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: c-can i
2018-10-02 13:46:56	+brooks	bdelloid: that's why it's called osmosis
2018-10-02 13:46:59	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, no
2018-10-02 13:47:03	+LambdaComplex	good
2018-10-02 13:47:11	+bdelloid	brooks, with what? myself?
2018-10-02 13:47:11	+brooks	I'm not talking about getting help, I'm talking about exposure to ideas and resources
2018-10-02 13:47:15	+bdelloid	oh
2018-10-02 13:47:21	+bdelloid	is this a programming community?
2018-10-02 13:47:25	+bdelloid	because we rarely talk about anything related
2018-10-02 13:47:29	+LambdaComplex	no #code is a communism community
2018-10-02 13:47:32	+brooks	we are right now
2018-10-02 13:47:35	+Kirjava	I guess exposure can be unfair in the same way that life is unfair
2018-10-02 13:47:37	+bdelloid	this is tangentially related
2018-10-02 13:47:53	+bdelloid	I don't even read chats
2018-10-02 13:47:55	+Kirjava	so you're saying we should try and account for these kind of things
2018-10-02 13:47:56	+bdelloid	I just shitpost
2018-10-02 13:48:04	+brooks	the myth of meritocracy is that anyone who doesn't succeed just couldn't cut it
2018-10-02 13:48:11	+brooks	yeah, sorta
2018-10-02 13:48:14	+brooks	I'm not saying that exactly
2018-10-02 13:48:27	+brooks	I'm more saying "you probably want to if you understand that the meritocracy thing just isn't true"
2018-10-02 13:48:40	+bdelloid	meritocracy within the people who actually can do things
2018-10-02 13:48:53	+brooks	how did they get to be people who can actually do things
2018-10-02 13:48:57	+bdelloid	if you always wanted to be a soccer player but you have no legs you can try doesn't mean you'll succeed
2018-10-02 13:49:30	+bdelloid	a part of merit is not being retarded and doing things you're just not fit for
2018-10-02 13:49:48	+bdelloid	I couldn't go to university
2018-10-02 13:49:54	+bdelloid	and I dropped out of high school
2018-10-02 13:50:07	+bdelloid	doesn't mean it's unfair
2018-10-02 13:50:17	+brooks	sure, but a part of becoming part of the club in the first place is being able to fit into a community. staying even though you don't fit in has disadvantages over *actually* fitting in, too
2018-10-02 13:50:36	+bdelloid	then don't
2018-10-02 13:50:40	+bdelloid	go do something else
2018-10-02 13:50:44	+bdelloid	because you refuse to fit or are unable to
2018-10-02 13:51:06	+brooks	what if we can make commonsense changes to enable people to fit in more easily and get the advantages we had?
2018-10-02 13:51:06	+bdelloid	you're a circle, stay with circles, you can try all you want but you won't go through that square door
2018-10-02 13:51:14	+bdelloid	no
2018-10-02 13:51:18	+brooks	why shouldn't we do that?
2018-10-02 13:51:22	+brooks	#code is built on this btw
2018-10-02 13:51:40	+brooks	it's not particularly obnoxious here I think
2018-10-02 13:52:01	+bdelloid	because you're asking to change people to fit others
2018-10-02 13:52:05	+bdelloid	instead of changing others to fit people
2018-10-02 13:52:14	+brooks	not really
2018-10-02 13:52:34	+bdelloid	then I have no idea what you're talking about
2018-10-02 13:52:40	+brooks	I set out to create a culture where the norms would be less offputting and nice people would hang out and be helpful
2018-10-02 13:52:59	+brooks	seems pretty commonsense and easy to me
2018-10-02 13:53:15	+bdelloid	and they still have their own communities as well
2018-10-02 13:53:20	+bdelloid	and people won't be in those
2018-10-02 13:53:21	+bdelloid	what's your point
2018-10-02 13:53:26	+bdelloid	you can't have everything be that way
2018-10-02 13:53:36	+brooks	"there's no reason not to do this where you can"
2018-10-02 13:53:39	+bdelloid	just create alternative spaces and hope people want to get in those and behave a certain way
2018-10-02 13:53:46	+brooks	or no reason why this shouldn't happen at all
2018-10-02 13:53:54	+bdelloid	there's a difference between creating alternative spaces
2018-10-02 13:53:55	+brooks	yeah, that's what we did
2018-10-02 13:53:58	+bdelloid	and replacing the current places with alternative ones
2018-10-02 13:54:04	+bdelloid	and that's okay
2018-10-02 13:54:05	+brooks	I think so to, to an extent
2018-10-02 13:54:49	+LambdaComplex	WE'LL JUST TAKE THE RACISTS AND PUSH THEM TO VOAT
2018-10-02 13:55:17	+Kirjava	or gab
2018-10-02 13:55:56	+brooks	but if you can admit that meritocracy is bullshit and there are other factors that contribute to being able to do the things you need to do to succeed, aside from just 'raw' aptitude, and you can admit that there are commonsense things you can do to improve the situation of people who the people who otherwise wouldn't be selected for reasons that have nothing to do with 'raw' aptitude,
2018-10-02 13:56:25	+bdelloid	brooks, it's not
2018-10-02 13:56:28	+brooks	then you can kind of squint and see how this diversity shit got started up, but more than that you can see why anyone thought it mattered in the first place- because it did, and does, and our myths suck
2018-10-02 13:56:42	+bdelloid	making sane decisions with your life is part of the meritocratic aspect
2018-10-02 13:56:54	+brooks	it's not meritocratic
2018-10-02 13:57:29	+brooks	if you're literally saying "people who would be kept out for reasons that have nothing to do with merit" then you're not describing meritocracy, you're describing social darwinism
2018-10-02 13:57:41	+brooks	s/would//
2018-10-02 13:58:00	+bdelloid	meritocracy can't exist within different levels, or it would never exist
2018-10-02 13:58:10	+brooks	which is like, fine, but the myth that only merit counts is harmful etc etc
2018-10-02 13:58:20	+bdelloid	it's not, you're just using it the wrong way
2018-10-02 13:58:46	+bdelloid	the set of people included in the meritocratic system is just implied
2018-10-02 13:59:01	+bdelloid	there are literal retards who'd never be able to do some things
2018-10-02 13:59:02	+bdelloid	ever
2018-10-02 13:59:13	+brooks	yeah, no one's denying that merit is an important factor
2018-10-02 13:59:14	+bdelloid	regardless of what kind of retarded solution you tried
2018-10-02 13:59:15	+brooks	of course it is
2018-10-02 13:59:43	+bdelloid	then all you're trying to do is extending the set of people involved in the system
2018-10-02 13:59:47	+bdelloid	and saying the system is not meritocratic
2018-10-02 13:59:50	+brooks	I'm just saying there are factors other than merit that count and if you build on the assumption that you actually can judge by merit alone, you'll get a lot of dumb shit with that
2018-10-02 13:59:50	+bdelloid	no shit, you changed the set
2018-10-02 14:00:15	+bdelloid	brb meeting

2018-10-02 14:00:44	+kori	good morning #code

2018-10-02 14:00:48	+LambdaComplex	this would be a lot nicer if bdelloid and brooks weren't the same color
2018-10-02 14:00:52	+brooks	by this logic, the set is still changed, and now people are in who wouldn't have been, and we're circled back to "merit isn't the only thing that matters"

2018-10-02 14:20:26	+brookz	it was not

2018-10-02 14:29:23	+brookz	bourbon is whiskey tho
2018-10-02 14:29:38	+Kirjava	indeed
2018-10-02 14:30:39	+brookz	bourbon is 'good whiskey for poor people' and that's cool with my inner commie
2018-10-02 14:30:51	+brookz	also pretty american, but like not in a terrible way
2018-10-02 14:35:16	+Arathnim	Bourbon is American by definition.
2018-10-02 14:35:35	+Kirjava	the horror
2018-10-02 14:36:49	+brookz	I meant culturally american, but yes, yes it is
2018-10-02 14:37:07	+LambdaComplex	tennessee whiskey is just bourbon
2018-10-02 14:37:09	+LambdaComplex	don't @ me
2018-10-02 14:37:24	+brookz	no it's not tennessee whiskey sucks
2018-10-02 14:37:33	+brookz	or at least jack sucks
2018-10-02 14:37:41	+brookz	you don't get the cherry undertones at all!
2018-10-02 14:38:13	+brookz	I'm not even sure the cherry undertone is universal in bourbon tbh
2018-10-02 14:38:43	+LambdaComplex	...tennessee whiskey is literally bourbon that's gone through a charcoal filter
2018-10-02 14:39:09	+Kirjava	I mean after like three it doesn't matter what it is
2018-10-02 14:39:28	+LambdaComplex	you could literally sell tennessee whiskey as bourbon without violating any regulations
2018-10-02 14:39:32	+brookz	really? that's hilarious
2018-10-02 14:40:14	+LambdaComplex	yes
2018-10-02 14:40:20	+LambdaComplex	but m a r k e t i n g
2018-10-02 14:40:21	+brookz	I actually thought it was the other way around, that bourbon was tennessee whiskey put through charred barrels
2018-10-02 14:40:22	+LambdaComplex	i guess
2018-10-02 14:40:38	+brookz	s/put through/aged in/
2018-10-02 14:40:57	+LambdaComplex	brookz: all bourbon is aged in charred oak barrels
2018-10-02 14:41:02	+brookz	yes
2018-10-02 14:41:12	+brookz	that's what I mean
2018-10-02 14:42:30	+brookz	Kirjava: yeah but I must drink it neat and mock weaklings who need ice or shots, how else will I feel superior
2018-10-02 14:42:59	+LambdaComplex	>drinking it neat
2018-10-02 14:43:01	+LambdaComplex	pfffffffft
2018-10-02 14:43:13	+LambdaComplex	you gotta add a bit of water so you can get more of the flavor
2018-10-02 14:43:17	+Kirjava	but it's nicer on the rox
2018-10-02 14:43:20	+LambdaComplex	if you drink it neat then it's too strong to fully appreciate
2018-10-02 14:43:29	+LambdaComplex	no, if you put it on the rocks then it gets more watered-down over time
2018-10-02 14:43:32	+LambdaComplex	it's not a consistent flavor
2018-10-02 14:43:36	+Kirjava	what if I like that
2018-10-02 14:43:41	+LambdaComplex	then you're wrong
2018-10-02 14:43:48	+Kirjava	I don't think that's how preference works
2018-10-02 14:43:50	+LambdaComplex	sorry brookz but i'm way better at elitism than you :3
2018-10-02 14:44:22	+brookz	something something whiskey stones
2018-10-02 14:44:28	+brookz	also yes I try to be terrible at elitism thank you
2018-10-02 14:44:47	+LambdaComplex	well that'll just chill it without watering it down
2018-10-02 14:44:55	+LambdaComplex	definitely a better choice than ice
2018-10-02 14:45:00	+LambdaComplex	but i still prefer just a little water

2018-10-02 14:54:18	+brookz	e.g. their rundown of the gnu/linux naming controversy doesn't actually make the argument for gnu/linux
2018-10-02 14:54:55	+brookz	oh never mind they kinda do
2018-10-02 14:55:00	+brookz	it's very clipped
2018-10-02 14:55:20	+brookz	it fucks it up by starting out like this: GNU/Linux was a term originally created by the Free Software Foundation to refer to the combination of the GNU corelibs and the Linux Kernel, which they argued to form a functioning operating system.

2018-10-02 15:45:39	+seeker	go isn't a real language
2018-10-02 15:46:06	+Kirjava	what definition of language are you using
2018-10-02 15:46:44	+seeker	"has generics"
2018-10-02 15:47:01	+Kirjava	lol momed
2018-10-02 15:48:02	+brookz	aren't generics like a bandaid to make up for shortcomings in a language or something
2018-10-02 15:48:04	+brookz	they always seemed like it to me
2018-10-02 15:48:16	+brookz	or am I misreading
2018-10-02 15:48:33	+seeker	well brookz i w as just helping Kirjava get on with real work
2018-10-02 15:48:35	+Kirjava	if by shortcomings you mean 'lack of dynamicism' then sure I guess
2018-10-02 15:48:44	+seeker	but to answer your question
2018-10-02 15:49:07	+seeker	in a dynamic typed language like javascript or lisp it's easy to make functions that work on lists of numbers or lists of strings
2018-10-02 15:49:18	+seeker	but in a typed language, unless you have generics, that would be 2 different functions
2018-10-02 15:49:33	+Kirjava	or you can use generics and have them autogenerated
2018-10-02 15:49:40	+Kirjava	at least, in languages with zero cost abstractions :3
2018-10-02 15:50:07	+seeker	that's correct but zero cost abstraction is a different thing
2018-10-02 15:50:20	+brookz	hm
2018-10-02 15:51:22	+Kirjava	well zero cost abstractions mean the generics are monomorphised as opposed to handled at runtime
2018-10-02 15:51:40	+brookz	does generics refer to a specific approach to writing functions that differ only in that they operate on different (but similar) types, or is it a term for any feature that does this?
2018-10-02 15:51:44	+Kirjava	handling them at runtime is different to autogenerating them
2018-10-02 15:52:29	+seeker	ah you're getting into the details of how it can be implemented
2018-10-02 15:52:54	+trinary	Reminder that zero-cost abstractions don't actually mean using them has no cost
2018-10-02 15:53:06	+Kirjava	zero runtime cost
2018-10-02 15:53:07	+brookz	I thought it was a specific feature, but now I think it means something more general
2018-10-02 15:53:08	+trinary	Just that you pay no more than if you had implemented it without the abstraction
2018-10-02 15:53:14	+trinary	Not even that, there is a runtime cost
2018-10-02 15:53:17	+Kirjava	oh
2018-10-02 15:53:24	+Kirjava	I guess by virtue of the binary being bigger
2018-10-02 15:55:02	+Kirjava	because surely it just hits a different pointer in the lookup table to execute a different function
2018-10-02 15:55:06	+Kirjava	there's no other runtime cost
2018-10-02 15:55:34	+Kirjava	brookz: I don't know. maybe in some languages it is used more loosely?
2018-10-02 15:56:16	+Kirjava	(as a term)
2018-10-02 15:56:21	+seeker	I would say it's: A way to define a parametric family of functions in one go, in a strongly typed language
2018-10-02 15:56:24	+trinary	Kirjava - Larger binary means colder functions and longer loading times
2018-10-02 15:56:39	+Kirjava	right
2018-10-02 15:56:40	+seeker	althoug maybe it doesn't have to be parametric, what do you all think?
2018-10-02 15:57:03	+Kirjava	I don't know what parametric means ;-;
2018-10-02 15:58:07	+brookz	when I read about it in the context of go, I thought it sounded like "go actually can't do this because it doesn't have anything that takes care of it, so we need to do it explicitly"
2018-10-02 15:59:08	+seeker	Kirjava, well it just means you can't do anything different depending on the type
2018-10-02 15:59:22	+seeker	as opposed to in object oriented coding where you might act diferent on certain types of objects
2018-10-02 15:59:48	+Kirjava	ah, okay
2018-10-02 16:00:17	+seeker	yeah brookz so unfortunately in go it's a bit of a hassle because you have to basically copy and paste your function and change it to work on adifferent type. Or use a dynamicly typed version, which is has the disadvantage of losing the nice static typping
2018-10-02 16:00:53	+seeker	i still find go pretty useful tool though, it's not a show stopping problem
2018-10-02 16:04:54	+naught0	what does Go do so right that people love it so much tho
2018-10-02 16:05:55	+naught0	Does it fill a niche or what
2018-10-02 16:05:57	+seeker	what i like about it is that it's sort of like C in some ways but it's got GC and strong types
2018-10-02 16:06:16	+seeker	so *most* tasks where I would have used C I can now use a much easier language
2018-10-02 16:06:23	+brookz	^
2018-10-02 16:06:27	+naught0	oh that is pretty great
2018-10-02 16:06:36	+naught0	does rust fill a similar slot or o
2018-10-02 16:06:39	+brookz	google made go to make things easier on their engineers
2018-10-02 16:06:40	+seeker	yeah rust too
2018-10-02 16:06:40	+brookz	yeah
2018-10-02 16:06:46	+naught0	neat
2018-10-02 16:06:48	+seeker	I personally find rust a lot harder to work with
2018-10-02 16:06:57	+trinary	Of course it is
2018-10-02 16:07:02	+seeker	because (A) its more complex (B) i haven't used it as much
2018-10-02 16:07:05	+seeker	but rust is great too
2018-10-02 16:07:13	+naught0	it forces you to be safe tho dunnit
2018-10-02 16:07:19	+naught0	that sounds inherently harder 
2018-10-02 16:07:19	+brookz	rust is less "this is like if C were more like python" and more "rust is like if you had a real language with memory safety but no gc to slow everything to a crawl"
2018-10-02 16:07:39	+brookz	yeah kinda
2018-10-02 16:07:45	+seeker	pretty much.. but I don't think GC is such a big slow down
2018-10-02 16:07:54	+brookz	I don't think it is either, in most cases
2018-10-02 16:07:57	+naught0	I just want a _supah fast_ language that's as piss easy as python tbh
2018-10-02 16:08:01	+naught0	that's why nim looked neat
2018-10-02 16:08:10	+brookz	go is typically used for things where gc isn't a problem
2018-10-02 16:09:24	+brookz	rust kinda is too, but. it's designed to be useful in places where it would be
2018-10-02 16:09:42	+brookz	it's also getting closer to being useful for embedded work
2018-10-02 16:10:32	+naught0	small bins?
2018-10-02 16:10:41	+brookz	no runtime
2018-10-02 16:10:49	+naught0	o
2018-10-02 16:10:53	+brookz	like you can use rust without the standard library
2018-10-02 16:10:53	+Kirjava	#![no_std]
2018-10-02 16:10:56	+brookz	^
2018-10-02 16:11:03	+naught0	spicy
2018-10-02 16:11:08	+Kirjava	you can use rust without the core even
2018-10-02 16:11:18	+naught0	how useful would it be at that point tho
2018-10-02 16:11:18	+darkwater	might as well use c
2018-10-02 16:11:20	+Kirjava	dunno why but
2018-10-02 16:11:33	+naught0	you'd have to manually write really basic things then yeah?
2018-10-02 16:11:37	+Kirjava	yes
2018-10-02 16:11:46	+Kirjava	like you'd have to implement your own vectores
2018-10-02 16:11:50	+Kirjava	*vectors
2018-10-02 16:11:54	+brookz	I think the theory is that you can use a (relatively) safe language to bootstrap the core and std library and slowly build out an operating system
2018-10-02 16:12:14	+naught0	what's that one OS built solely with rust
2018-10-02 16:12:15	+brookz	I'm not sure anyone is actually doing this, but it's important if you want rust to be able to compete with C at every level
2018-10-02 16:12:18	+naught0	and is it awful still
2018-10-02 16:12:19	+brookz	redox?
2018-10-02 16:12:20	+naught0	yeah
2018-10-02 16:12:33	+brookz	probably
2018-10-02 16:12:53	+brookz	https://intermezzos.github.io/ this is a thing too
2018-10-02 16:13:02	+brookz	it's mostly dead though
2018-10-02 16:14:33	+naught0	wtf the kernel is like 5 lines of code
2018-10-02 16:14:36	+naught0	unless I'm missing something
2018-10-02 16:15:09	+brookz	most of it is probably in vga?
2018-10-02 16:15:52	+naught0	ok so like... 300 lines?
2018-10-02 16:15:55	+naught0	lol
2018-10-02 16:15:57	+brookz	is also uses a bootloader crate
2018-10-02 16:16:01	+naught0	ah ok
2018-10-02 16:16:08	+brookz	but, yeah
2018-10-02 16:16:08	+Kirjava	if we're talking about good things rust can do
2018-10-02 16:16:16	+Kirjava	it's pretty much the best choice for WASM atm too
2018-10-02 16:16:47	+naught0	imagine if the web was built from python instead of javascript
2018-10-02 16:16:54	+Kirjava	it would still be terrible
2018-10-02 16:16:57	+brookz	I'd kms
2018-10-02 16:17:01	+brookz	I'm barely even joking
2018-10-02 16:17:02	+naught0	I contend it'd be less terrible :>
2018-10-02 16:17:05	+brookz	it would not
2018-10-02 16:17:07	+Kirjava	you don't understand
2018-10-02 16:17:10	+naught0	I'd succ that snek all day tbh
2018-10-02 16:17:15	+Kirjava	python would then need to be 100% backwards compatible
2018-10-02 16:17:20	+brookz	javascript is an incredibly powerful and flexible language
2018-10-02 16:17:23	+Kirjava	so it'd be a continuation of python 1
2018-10-02 16:17:24	+naught0	2to3 amirite
2018-10-02 16:17:31	+brookz	yeah
2018-10-02 16:17:31	+naught0	1to3
2018-10-02 16:17:36	+brookz	this is a big part of why js is so shit
2018-10-02 16:17:44	+Kirjava	also, the problems from the web mostly arise from browser apis, not js itself
2018-10-02 16:17:47	+brookz	it can't break the web
2018-10-02 16:17:49	+brookz	yeah
2018-10-02 16:17:50	+Kirjava	the DOM has nothing to do with JS
2018-10-02 16:17:53	+brookz	yep

2018-10-02 16:19:46	+Kirjava	I think that's the only really bad thing in JS
2018-10-02 16:19:50	+Kirjava	well, that and with()
2018-10-02 16:19:57	+Kirjava	everything else can be defended pretty easily

2018-10-02 16:20:55	+bdelloid	reee
2018-10-02 16:20:59	+bdelloid	they interrupted my meeting
2018-10-02 16:21:18	+naught0	> having meetings
2018-10-02 16:21:24	+naught0	way to be a cog in the capitalist machine 
2018-10-02 16:21:43	+bdelloid	yes
2018-10-02 16:21:46	+bdelloid	thank you
2018-10-02 16:21:49	+bdelloid	I try my best
2018-10-02 16:21:57	+naught0	:)
2018-10-02 16:23:14	+Kirjava	> using == instead of ===
2018-10-02 16:23:22	+Kirjava	what did you think was gonna happen
2018-10-02 16:24:05	+Kirjava	why is everyone's complaint about js "I used type coersion and got weird results" 
2018-10-02 16:24:17	+Kirjava	did you try not using type coercion
2018-10-02 16:24:35	+naught0	it was just a meme dad
2018-10-02 16:24:40	+brookz	because they're used to == in other languages and don't really know they should be using ===
2018-10-02 16:24:57	+Kirjava	dont 3 lazy learn lang
2018-10-02 16:25:54	+brookz	also because they don't read js the goodparts, develop an intense hatred for crockford, and then go read you don't know javascript to have all their criticisms of crockford elaborated on in depth and proved justified
2018-10-02 16:26:12	+bdelloid	I would feel bad if I were called cockford
2018-10-02 16:26:15	+brookz	s/good/good /
2018-10-02 16:26:21	+bdelloid	you're such a cockford
2018-10-02 16:26:32	+brookz	i-it's crockford, but same and it still applies
2018-10-02 16:26:37	+Kirjava	brookz: yeah, sounds about right 
2018-10-02 16:26:38	+bdelloid	yeah but the r is silent
2018-10-02 16:26:47	+brookz	it ia??
2018-10-02 16:26:49	+brookz	is
2018-10-02 16:26:55	+naught0	brookz pls
2018-10-02 16:26:56	+Kirjava	I mean tbh I used to use == all the time and it was fine because I didn't try adding arrays an objects together
2018-10-02 16:26:58	+bdelloid	you're just trying to blame other people for using a blade with no handle
2018-10-02 16:27:06	+bdelloid	and being like "yeah but if you hold it by the side you don't get cut as badly"
2018-10-02 16:27:11	+bdelloid	like fuck off
2018-10-02 16:27:17	+Kirjava	you dont get cut at all
2018-10-02 16:27:21	+bdelloid	same shit
2018-10-02 16:27:22	+bdelloid	analogy applies
2018-10-02 16:27:29	+bdelloid	f u c k o f f
2018-10-02 16:27:32	+brookz	+ shouldn't have been used for both addition and concat tbh
2018-10-02 16:27:33	+Kirjava	nah
2018-10-02 16:27:33	+Kirjava	:3
2018-10-02 16:27:47	+bdelloid	sorry I get heated during technical meetings
2018-10-02 16:28:37	+naught0	clearly
2018-10-02 16:29:10	+bdelloid	what did you just call my mom
2018-10-02 16:29:26	+naught0	well I sure didn't call her for dinner
2018-10-02 16:29:45	+bdelloid	you fucking asshole, she was crying all night, you'll regret this
2018-10-02 16:29:52	+naught0	^_^
2018-10-02 16:29:56	+naught0	fucking asshole is right
2018-10-02 16:30:20	+bdelloid	yeah, she always liked shitting on dicks
2018-10-02 16:30:28	+naught0	zoinks scoob
2018-10-02 16:30:36	+LambdaComplex	wew
2018-10-02 16:30:43	+brookz	naught0: anyway! python's main advantage is the wealth of existing software and how easy it is to pick up. the *language* isn't particularly good, and until recently you generally only used maybe one library for javascript, often starting out from scratch. a more powerful smalltalk-inspired language with a C syntax slapped on is a better fit for that kind of environment
2018-10-02 16:31:07	+bdelloid	fuck, can I do it again, I have a better one
2018-10-02 16:31:09	+brookz	also I would cry even more if I had to write python
2018-10-02 16:31:22	+bdelloid	"yeah, she always liked crying because of dicks"
2018-10-02 16:31:26	+bdelloid	no, that's weak
2018-10-02 16:31:26	+naught0	the only language I barely know is python
2018-10-02 16:31:28	+bdelloid	whatever
2018-10-02 16:31:31	+naught0	which should really explain the shilling
2018-10-02 16:31:33	+bdelloid	Python sucks
2018-10-02 16:31:34	+naught0	ty for that insight though
2018-10-02 16:31:44	+brookz	python is like, not awful
2018-10-02 16:31:57	+naught0	bdelloid: it doesn't suck at what it's good at though
2018-10-02 16:32:10	+brookz	but I'd rather be forced to use JS (as I am, since I'm using the web under duress) than forced to use python
2018-10-02 16:32:39	+Kirjava	some people use JS by choice :3
2018-10-02 16:32:54	+brookz	I started out using it by choice
2018-10-02 16:33:26	+bdelloid	Kirjava, I thought it was like being gay
2018-10-02 16:33:36	+brookz	now I'm living in a bleak dystopia where the web is my operating system and javascript is the new C
2018-10-02 16:33:52	+brookz	and so now it's under duress
2018-10-02 16:34:00	+bdelloid	just stop using browsers
2018-10-02 16:34:06	+brookz	I can't
2018-10-02 16:34:10	+Kirjava	browsers are great
2018-10-02 16:34:14	+Kirjava	^^
2018-10-02 16:34:18	+brookz	mozilla broke my heart
2018-10-02 16:34:33	+brookz	and I have to keep defending them because if they're gone we're fucked
2018-10-02 16:34:46	+seeker	tfw T_T
2018-10-02 16:35:01	+naught0	how does one not use a browser
2018-10-02 16:35:14	+brookz	idk I can almost get there
2018-10-02 16:35:16	+brookz	almost
2018-10-02 16:35:22	+naught0	how 2 browse the web
2018-10-02 16:35:27	+Kirjava	bdelloid: it is ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2018-10-02 16:35:28	+naught0	just curl every page

2018-10-02 16:37:05	+naught0	are those not browsers
2018-10-02 16:37:17	+brookz	they're browsers in the old fashioned sense

2018-10-02 16:42:51	+isk	basically it's doing printenv but appending every variable with "declare -x"
2018-10-02 16:48:45	+Kirjava	ugh tfw you say something and the person says "haha, yeah" and they face says "I have no idea what that means"
2018-10-02 16:48:50	+Kirjava	*their face
2018-10-02 16:49:50	+naught0	I do that all the time
2018-10-02 16:49:57	+brookz	haha, yeah
2018-10-02 16:50:02	+Kirjava	ಠ_ಠ
2018-10-02 16:50:03	+seeker	lol
2018-10-02 16:50:06	+seeker	i do that so much
2018-10-02 16:50:15	+seeker	i dont know what FUCK people are saying ;-;
2018-10-02 16:50:23	+brookz	I never do that, I will make it awkward for you and everyone around us, idgaf
2018-10-02 16:50:43	+naught0	I can hear all the sounds but I can't make out the words for some reason all the heckin time
2018-10-02 16:50:54	+brookz	isk: what's a dead.letter
2018-10-02 16:50:57	+Kirjava	surely it's more awkward to pretend you understood
2018-10-02 16:51:02	+naught0	it's not
2018-10-02 16:51:04	+brookz	it is for me
2018-10-02 16:51:15	+naught0	the amount of times I would have to say "what?" "pardon?" "sorry, what?"
2018-10-02 16:51:22	+Kirjava	it is because I'm sure the other person notices that you didn't understand like everytime
2018-10-02 16:51:24	+naught0	it's just easier to say "haha, yeah"
2018-10-02 16:51:32	+brookz	yeah I just say "sorry I didn't get that" several times a day
2018-10-02 16:51:43	+naught0	I deal with unperceptive apes all day Kirjava 
2018-10-02 16:52:08	+naught0	I mean, who else walks into a ape shop let's be real
2018-10-02 16:52:38	+naught0	s/ape/vape/
2018-10-02 16:52:54	+brookz	all the people I know who vape are really interesting and perceptive
2018-10-02 16:52:57	+brookz	lmao
2018-10-02 16:53:11	+naught0	do they live in south FL
2018-10-02 16:53:12	+naught0	if not
2018-10-02 16:53:18	+brookz	you GOT ME THERE
2018-10-02 16:53:19	+naught0	ur sample is all wrong 
2018-10-02 16:53:41	+naught0	tbh a lot of the people that come in are totally great
2018-10-02 16:53:48	+naught0	I'm just being edgy because I forgot my lunch today :(
2018-10-02 16:54:22	+brookz	rip
2018-10-02 16:55:35	+LambdaComplex	haha, yeah
2018-10-02 16:55:40	+naught0	^
2018-10-02 16:55:45	+isk	brookz: when cron receives stderr it tries to email, but I don't have an email specified so it mails it to the $HOME of the cron user
2018-10-02 16:55:59	+isk	i.e. it records the error in /root/dead.letter
2018-10-02 16:56:22	+isk	basically just means my cron job is getting some weird STDERR
2018-10-02 16:56:25	+brookz	oh
2018-10-02 17:03:37	+brookz	huh
2018-10-02 17:03:44	+brookz	I have no idea what would cause that
2018-10-02 17:04:38	+brookz	also
2018-10-02 17:04:53	+brookz	where can I get all the xv6 lectures
2018-10-02 17:04:57	+brookz	only some are on youtube
2018-10-02 17:21:16	+brookz	naught0: I read earlier today the unix kernel in 1974-1975 was about 10k lines and that was before ANSI C
2018-10-02 17:24:34	+Kirjava	the mono runtime for wasm is only 1MB
2018-10-02 17:24:37	+Kirjava	quite surprised
2018-10-02 17:24:41	+Kirjava	thought would be much bigger
2018-10-02 17:24:55	+Kirjava	I mean, it's still kind of a problem
2018-10-02 17:41:02	+naught0	brookz: that sounds yuge
2018-10-02 17:42:36	+brookz	for comparison, the linux kernel is about 1 million lines
2018-10-02 17:42:48	+brookz	it's small
2018-10-02 17:42:58	+brookz	I mean, the size of a mature code base
2018-10-02 17:43:03	+brookz	but small
2018-10-02 17:44:07	+trinary	1M? Where did you get that number?
2018-10-02 17:44:13	+trinary	https://www.linuxcounter.net/statistics/kernel
2018-10-02 17:45:07	+brookz	a hacker news headline a few years ago, I think? I may be confusing it with something else
2018-10-02 17:45:36	+trinary	Seeing as how this counter says 20M, I believe you are
2018-10-02 17:46:23	+brookz	whoa
2018-10-02 17:46:45	+trinary	Now you could make an argument that not all of that code is built for every configuration
2018-10-02 17:46:52	+brookz	well, yeah
2018-10-02 17:47:03	+brookz	> Linux Kernel Exceeds 15 million LOC 
2018-10-02 17:47:07	+brookz	"7 years ago"
2018-10-02 17:47:31	+brookz	I'm not sure of the date
2018-10-02 17:47:48	+Vez	why do I need drivers for every computer that ever existed on my watch
2018-10-02 17:49:01	+brookz	you don't, you can build the kernel with the drivers you want and never have to worry about the ones you don't
2018-10-02 17:49:15	+brookz	and, someone else is probably taking care of it for you
2018-10-02 17:49:48	+Vez	cool
2018-10-02 17:52:33	+brookz	if you get a chance to configure a kernel sometime, it's pretty neat how it works
2018-10-02 17:52:52	+brookz	you run make menuconfig or make nconfig and then navigate menus and submenus
2018-10-02 17:53:48	+trinary	Yes, very fun
2018-10-02 17:54:40	+brookz	idk about *fun*, most of the time I'm sort of mad at it, but it's interesting
2018-10-02 17:54:54	+brookz	if you insist on going through all of it, it can get overwhelming
2018-10-02 18:02:23	+naught0	probably a lot easier to just plug in all your devices and make a local config
2018-10-02 18:02:39	+naught0	should be relatively automagic
2018-10-02 18:03:51	+naught0	plus if you need more drivers you can just recompile with a new option enabled 
2018-10-02 18:03:53	+naught0	 /shrug
2018-10-02 18:04:24	+brookz	I just meant for reference
2018-10-02 18:04:43	+brookz	also, related question, how do I see which firmware I'm using in /lib/firmware
2018-10-02 18:05:20	+naught0	ls /lib/firmware :~)
2018-10-02 18:05:43	+naught0	(no idea)
2018-10-02 18:08:31	+brookz	boot will probably tell me
2018-10-02 18:08:37	+brookz	if I just boot without it
2018-10-02 18:10:00	+naught0	hmmm
2018-10-02 18:10:09	+naught0	you should be able to find it
2018-10-02 18:10:14	+naught0	idk how tho
2018-10-02 18:18:17	+Nux	hi #code

2018-10-02 19:37:21	+kori	can't get it out is suprisingly poppy

2018-10-02 19:37:37	+naught0	brookz: daisy bad album y,n
2018-10-02 19:37:44	+brookz	I haven't heard it
2018-10-02 19:37:50	+brookz	I've literally only listened to the devil and god
2018-10-02 19:37:51	+naught0	lucky
2018-10-02 19:38:13	+brookz	I listened to millstone by chance once and didn't want to hear the rest of the album because I hate the theme
2018-10-02 19:38:29	+naught0	big edge
2018-10-02 19:38:31	+kori	brookz: you've listened to lit me up, no?

2018-10-02 19:38:52	+naught0	I saw them live btw
2018-10-02 19:38:55	+Nux	you just copy the mag links
2018-10-02 19:38:56	+brookz	I kept listening to the same songs and then one or two more until I had heard it all and would listen to the album

2018-10-02 19:39:59	+brookz	I have to check hashes at the least and I prefer to compile my own
2018-10-02 19:40:07	+Nux	brookz: just once
2018-10-02 19:40:21	+Nux	and you really dont have to do that

2018-10-02 19:41:17	+kori	paranoia is communist and the more paranoic you are the more communist it is

2018-10-02 19:42:55	+Nux	you gotta realize they are used to attacks
2018-10-02 19:42:59	+Nux	and really watch it
2018-10-02 19:43:00	+brookz	you can get certs for pretty much whatever domain you want, especially if you're the government of most countries
2018-10-02 19:43:11	+Nux	i mean if they can protect millions of ppl from being caught doing shit
2018-10-02 19:43:19	+Nux	im p sure they can properly secure a website
2018-10-02 19:43:28	+brookz	it's not their security I'm worried about
2018-10-02 19:43:53	+brookz	the only way this is even detectable is if they have systems in place to check their site from various ISPs and proxy/vpn services
2018-10-02 19:44:01	+Nux	yes
2018-10-02 19:44:12	+Nux	you also gotta remember their employees are constantly targeted
2018-10-02 19:44:25	+Nux	one of the girls actually had her keyboard intercepted by nsa tao dudes
2018-10-02 19:44:35	+Nux	and they put some shit in the cord for it
2018-10-02 19:44:44	+Nux	they intercept mail
2018-10-02 19:44:46	+Nux	btw

2018-10-02 19:48:18	+brookz	kori: I did listen to lit me up
2018-10-02 19:48:22	+brookz	I forgot till just now though
2018-10-02 19:48:29	+kori	the wise man bowed his head solemnly and spoke: "theres actually zero difference between good & bad things. you imbecile. you fucking moron"
2018-10-02 19:48:42	+brookz	good quote

2018-10-02 19:54:41	+naught0	most useless arch derivative: Anarchy Linux
2018-10-02 19:55:02	+brookz	if you don't know, nietzsche thought the decline of christianity was even worse than christiainty itself and the ubermensch was his solution to the loss of a christ figure
2018-10-02 19:55:54	+naught0	this appeals to my messiah complex
2018-10-02 19:56:02	+naught0	you have done nothing but empower me you fool
2018-10-02 19:56:22	+dysfigured	hh
2018-10-02 19:56:26	+brookz	that's fine, now you can LARP *and* actually back it up with corrections when nerds try to call you out
2018-10-02 19:56:28	+brookz	hi dysfigured 
2018-10-02 19:56:42	+dysfigured	oh brookz has a new nick+color now. exciting.

2018-10-02 19:57:16	+brookz	I mean color
2018-10-02 19:57:17	+brookz	it's not reg'd
2018-10-02 19:57:52	+naught0	tfw colorscheme generator generates 8 colors and not 16 
2018-10-02 19:58:01	+brookz	tfw
2018-10-02 19:58:14	+naught0	too damn convenient to give a heck tbh
2018-10-02 20:04:55	+brookz	I just got to that song naught0 and it's hurting my soul thanks
2018-10-02 20:06:13	+naught0	it gives me the big oof
2018-10-02 20:06:22	+naught0	I am not kidding when I say I cried the first listen
2018-10-02 20:06:25	+naught0	in a work environment
2018-10-02 20:06:44	+naught0	I gave 0 hecks
2018-10-02 20:06:54	+brookz	yeah it fucked me up
2018-10-02 20:08:00	+naught0	the whole album does great with dynamics
2018-10-02 20:08:09	+naught0	hypes you up and then makes you depressed :D
2018-10-02 20:18:18	+kori	brookz: which song
2018-10-02 20:19:59	+kori	oh
2018-10-02 20:20:03	+brookz	could never be heaven
2018-10-02 20:20:03	+isk	Kirjava: thoughts on writing a Pi HTML server in Rust?
2018-10-02 20:20:04	+kori	could never be heaven?
2018-10-02 20:20:06	+brookz	yeah
2018-10-02 20:20:11	+kori	ye
2018-10-02 20:20:13	+kori	its gud
2018-10-02 20:20:41	+dysfigured	isk: we don't need more html servers
2018-10-02 20:21:00	+brookz	do it anyway
2018-10-02 20:21:12	+kori	wait till you get to desert brookz 
2018-10-02 20:21:20	+brookz	I already read desert
2018-10-02 20:21:25	+brookz	ay
2018-10-02 20:21:26	+kori	g-gottem
2018-10-02 20:21:34	+naught0	idgi
2018-10-02 20:21:47	+brookz	there's a book called desert
2018-10-02 20:21:55	+naught0	I figured that much
2018-10-02 20:22:05	+naught0	is there a history here or was it that shallow
2018-10-02 20:22:06	+naught0	if so, 3/10
2018-10-02 20:22:10	+naught0	you can do better
2018-10-02 20:22:30	+naught0	I'm gonna write my own word processor
2018-10-02 20:22:35	+naught0	because all these other ones are boring
2018-10-02 20:22:51	+brookz	it's nonfiction about how the environment and the future of the planet is basically fucked and it's too late and kori and I have talked about whether/when to read it a lot
2018-10-02 20:22:51	+naught0	it's gonna be: 1. awful; 2. terrible; 3. abandoned after realizing GUI is hard
2018-10-02 20:23:03	+naught0	brookz: ok you get a 7 this time
2018-10-02 20:23:06	+naught0	watch urself next time
2018-10-02 20:23:08	+naught0	>:{
2018-10-02 20:23:08	+brookz	kek
2018-10-02 20:23:12	+brookz	you should read it
2018-10-02 20:23:16	+brookz	but not if you're suicidal
2018-10-02 20:23:23	+naught0	I am highly suicidal sometimes
2018-10-02 20:23:26	+naught0	so I will avoid it
2018-10-02 20:23:30	+brookz	then I'd advise against
2018-10-02 20:23:32	+brookz	yeah
2018-10-02 20:23:38	+naught0	like there are times where I want to buy a gun because self-defense and cool factor
2018-10-02 20:23:43	+naught0	and then other times where I'm very glad I don't have a gun
2018-10-02 20:23:45	+naught0	u feel
2018-10-02 20:24:02	+brookz	it's actually got a really uplifting ending but it's hard to see that because the entire rest of the book is about tearing down your worldview
2018-10-02 20:24:11	+brookz	and also because the ending is still kinda bleak
2018-10-02 20:24:14	+brookz	also yeah
2018-10-02 20:24:30	+naught0	that sounds painful lol
2018-10-02 20:24:39	+naught0	I will continue to live in relative blissful ignorance
2018-10-02 20:24:47	+naught0	what is the deal with PyQt btw
2018-10-02 20:24:52	+naught0	is it free, is it not, is open source, is it closed
2018-10-02 20:25:05	+brookz	pretty sure it's both?
2018-10-02 20:25:09	+brookz	it got rewritten recently
2018-10-02 20:25:15	+naught0	qt5 vs 4?
2018-10-02 20:25:18	+brookz	yeah
2018-10-02 20:25:33	+brookz	qt4 is deprecated I think and the new pyqt is pyqt5
2018-10-02 20:25:38	+brookz	pyqt seems good btw
2018-10-02 20:25:49	+brookz	if I were writing GUIs it'd be one of the things I'd begrudgingly consider
2018-10-02 20:26:49	+dysfigured	Kirjava: how's your weechat
2018-10-02 20:27:03	+naught0	from http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/pyqt4_differences.html 
2018-10-02 20:27:08	+naught0	it looks like pyqt5 is a better option
2018-10-02 20:27:11	+brookz	it is
2018-10-02 20:27:24	+naught0	inb4 I realize how little I know about anything

2018-10-02 20:31:12	+bdelloid	lmao just make an android app and deploy it bundled with the android emulator
2018-10-02 20:31:15	+cosarara	making electron guis is a sin btw
2018-10-02 20:31:18	+bdelloid	but then use react native for it
2018-10-02 20:31:24	+naught0	I'm doing a thing 4fun
2018-10-02 20:31:28	+naught0	like a text editor

2018-10-02 21:02:41	+naught0	the options are limitless
2018-10-02 21:02:55	+naught0	tfw just discovered ctrl+l instead of `clear`
2018-10-02 21:03:00	+brookz	no they aren't it's python, you have 1 option, maybe 3
2018-10-02 21:03:02	+naught0	like afew weeks ago but still
2018-10-02 21:03:13	+naught0	brookz I can think of like 20 different ways to do this
2018-10-02 21:03:13	+brookz	nice
2018-10-02 21:03:16	+brookz	ctl+l is nice
2018-10-02 21:03:17	+naught0	in python
2018-10-02 21:03:23	+brookz	it's a meme u dip

2018-10-02 21:03:29	+naught0	whoops
2018-10-02 21:03:45	+winny	in python there is usually only one idiomatic way to do a simple thing
2018-10-02 21:03:50	+brookz	yeah
2018-10-02 21:03:58	+brookz	that's what I was getting at
2018-10-02 21:04:03	+winny	this is why i like python
2018-10-02 21:04:10	+brookz	also I don't mean to mock ur language too much
2018-10-02 21:04:25	+winny	python has some warts natch
2018-10-02 21:04:28	+brookz	it's a strength, just not one I want
2018-10-02 21:04:32	+yossarian	(unless you're trying to format a string)
2018-10-02 21:04:38	+yossarian	then there are like 8 different ways to do it
2018-10-02 21:04:39	+winny	yossarian: touche
2018-10-02 21:05:06	+winny	i know the percent op is deprecated, so that leaves three other ways people use a lot
2018-10-02 21:05:07	+yossarian	i've been writing python for work for the last few months, it's alright
2018-10-02 21:05:23	+brookz	wait % op is deprecated?
2018-10-02 21:05:29	+yossarian	is it formally deprecated, or "just don't use it" deprecated?
2018-10-02 21:05:31	+brookz	this was one of the things I actually liked about python
2018-10-02 21:05:39	+winny	""s, %s, %s" % (1,2,3)
2018-10-02 21:05:48	+winny	it's just formally deprecated
2018-10-02 21:06:07	+winny	idk why you'd use it though tbh, you don't have a lot of flexibility
2018-10-02 21:06:28	+naught0	fstrings are highly superior
2018-10-02 21:06:40	+winny	tbh im not sold on fstrings
2018-10-02 21:06:45	+naught0	f'{a_variable}' is neat af
2018-10-02 21:06:49	+winny	i really like what it can do to simplify code
2018-10-02 21:07:18	+winny	actually what am i saying
2018-10-02 21:07:20	+winny	im okay wit it
2018-10-02 21:07:35	+winny	string interpolation is bae
2018-10-02 21:07:40	+brookz	I like how ruby (and now js) do it
2018-10-02 21:07:48	+brookz	"#{var}" or `${var}`
2018-10-02 21:07:50	+winny	some guys were discovering string interpolation in php for the first time
2018-10-02 21:07:57	+naught0	brookz: that's how the fstrings r
2018-10-02 21:08:03	+naught0	like almost exactly
2018-10-02 21:08:08	+brookz	it looks a little strange
2018-10-02 21:08:15	+brookz	oh I see
2018-10-02 21:08:21	+winny	it follows suite with python string.format
2018-10-02 21:08:30	+winny	just less verbose
2018-10-02 21:08:30	+naught0	py> s="no it doesn't"; print(f'{s}')
2018-10-02 21:08:31	+meep	> no it doesn't
2018-10-02 21:08:45	+naught0	shrug
2018-10-02 21:09:01	+naught0	py> s="no it doesn't"; print(f'{s[:-2]}')
2018-10-02 21:09:02	+winny	py> s="but it does"; print('{s}'.format(s=s)
2018-10-02 21:09:02	+meep	> no it doesn
2018-10-02 21:09:02	+meep	> File "/input", line 2⏎     ⏎                                             ^⏎ SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
2018-10-02 21:09:03	+naught0	I think it's neat
2018-10-02 21:09:07	+naught0	nice
2018-10-02 21:09:09	+naught0	gj me
2018-10-02 21:09:10	+winny	py> s="but it does"; print('{s}'.format(s=s))
2018-10-02 21:09:10	+meep	> but it does

2018-10-02 21:09:14	+meep	> I am a string
2018-10-02 21:09:39	+brookz	python's slicing is pretty cool too
2018-10-02 21:09:42	+naught0	meep is a string
2018-10-02 21:09:42	+brookz	I miss that in js

2018-10-02 21:18:24	+winny	naught0: is python your fav lang
2018-10-02 21:18:51	+brookz	winny: how do you like both python and lisp btw, why do you think python doesn't feel constricting?
2018-10-02 21:19:13	+brookz	I think maybe if I tried it again, I would be less bothered because I know other languages and I can just switch if I don't feel like using it for a given project
2018-10-02 21:19:43	+brookz	or is there something specific for you
2018-10-02 21:19:43	+winny	i think you misunderstand
2018-10-02 21:19:49	+winny	more syntax is more constricting
2018-10-02 21:20:37	+brookz	hm
2018-10-02 21:21:07	+winny	python is pretty inhibited compared to scheme i guess but it never seemed to matter in practice
2018-10-02 21:21:47	+brookz	I did perl, then had to quit perl, and picked up python so maybe it was more that contrast than anything
2018-10-02 21:22:26	+winny	perl has a lot of history behinds its design choices
2018-10-02 21:22:53	+brookz	I liked perl a lot, so python probably felt like putting on handcuffs
2018-10-02 21:22:59	+winny	one of the first or the first non-c languages to become popular on *nix
2018-10-02 21:23:52	+brookz	I miss it
2018-10-02 21:23:57	+brookz	cpan kinda sucks though
2018-10-02 21:23:59	+winny	i think perl lets you do a lot of things that are hard to read and require knowledge of a lot of syntax that feels optional
2018-10-02 21:24:06	+brookz	it is optional

2018-10-02 21:26:51	+kori	i like this one
2018-10-02 21:27:02	+brookz	I don't think perl is perfect, I think it's expressive. it's not clean, not particularly elegant, but it is powerful and easy to love
2018-10-02 21:27:06	+winny	i just dislike a language that has all these needless features in the language itself, it makes the core code specimens difficult to reason about
2018-10-02 21:27:30	+brookz	kori: I thought of a new vhost but I instantly forgot it
2018-10-02 21:28:18	+brookz	I'm bummed out
2018-10-02 21:28:55	+brookz	winny: yeah I think that makes plenty of sense
2018-10-02 21:29:29	+brookz	but as a young, beginning programmer, perl had me writing a lot of code really quickly and I probably never felt so good as I did back then
2018-10-02 21:29:44	+winny	:3
2018-10-02 21:29:48	+kori	ur gonna remember it brookz 
2018-10-02 21:30:16	+brookz	partly because I was so young, I think
2018-10-02 21:30:22	+brookz	as you get older, those highs are harder to hit
2018-10-02 21:30:30	+brookz	or, as I get older, anyway
2018-10-02 21:30:38	+winny	u know what is always rewarding
2018-10-02 21:30:44	+winny	teaching ppl these things
2018-10-02 21:30:53	+winny	also undoing the damage they learned in university
2018-10-02 21:31:12	+winny	it's pretty sad some of the things students learn about programming in uni even today
2018-10-02 21:31:33	+brookz	sch-school's not a place for smart people
2018-10-02 21:31:59	+winny	because the ppl who learn in university are a lot less flexible about their thinking about programming unless they really go beyond what they're taught
2018-10-02 21:32:26	+brookz	yep
2018-10-02 21:32:39	+brookz	that's how they get you
2018-10-02 21:32:47	+brookz	university used to not be a school
2018-10-02 21:32:54	+brookz	now it's a factory for producing workers
2018-10-02 21:33:10	+winny	tbh i've learned quite a bit but now im paying for it
2018-10-02 21:33:16	+winny	with taking piddly classes
2018-10-02 21:33:54	+brookz	yeah it's not that what it provides can't be used
2018-10-02 21:35:20	+naught0	winny: it's my fave lang because it's the only lang I can do something non-trivial in
2018-10-02 21:35:43	+winny	why's that
2018-10-02 21:35:51	+naught0	because I'm not a superhackerboi
2018-10-02 21:35:58	+winny	o-oh
2018-10-02 21:36:08	+naught0	why's that to which part tho
2018-10-02 21:36:32	+winny	is it the only lang u know this well?
2018-10-02 21:36:39	+naught0	100%
2018-10-02 21:36:43	+naught0	and I don't know it very well :D
2018-10-02 21:36:45	+winny	just gauging what ur experience is

2018-10-02 21:37:09	+winny	Arathnim: im still curious what linux distro is it
2018-10-02 21:37:23	+brookz	Larry: A couple of years ago, I ran into someone at a trade show who was representing the NSA (National Security Agency). He mentioned to someone else in passing that he'd written a filter program in Perl, so without telling him who I was, I asked him if I could tell people that the NSA uses Perl. His response was, “Doesn't everyone?” So now I don't tell people the NSA uses Perl. I merely tell
2018-10-02 21:37:25	+brookz	people the NSA thinks everyone uses Perl. They should know, after all.
2018-10-02 21:37:28	+brookz	lolololololololol holy shit 
2018-10-02 21:37:32	+brookz	kms
2018-10-02 21:37:46	+Arathnim	eOS
2018-10-02 21:37:49	+brookz	nice!
2018-10-02 21:37:57	+brookz	what's your impression
2018-10-02 21:38:06	+winny	huh never heard of eOS
2018-10-02 21:38:15	+brookz	I bet you have
2018-10-02 21:38:19	+brookz	the e is for elementary
2018-10-02 21:38:22	+winny	oh
2018-10-02 21:38:38	+winny	heard it's bretty good
2018-10-02 21:38:54	+Arathnim	It has solid defaults and the WM is a great starting point for customization.
2018-10-02 21:39:18	+winny	i've been surveying distros suitable for beginners, i haven't looked at eOS yet
2018-10-02 21:40:06	+winny	i looked at linux mint yesterday
2018-10-02 21:40:15	+brookz	I was rooting for elementary really hard a few years ago, but it seems like they aren't doing the kind of groundbreaking things I wanted to see start happening when they showed up
2018-10-02 21:40:17	+winny	i can see the appeal
2018-10-02 21:41:13	+brookz	I used linux mint at one time
2018-10-02 21:41:18	+brookz	before it was MATE
2018-10-02 21:41:21	+winny	linux mint feels like gnome 2 ubuntu but a lot more polished
2018-10-02 21:42:13	+brookz	I had the impression it went to shit years ago and can't be trusted, so I stopped suggesting it to people
2018-10-02 21:42:26	+brookz	but it was a pleasant experience at the time
2018-10-02 21:42:39	+brookz	I was using the debian edition, which broke a lot, but I still loved it
2018-10-02 21:42:45	+winny	oh, why can't it be trusted, i really don't know much about it
2018-10-02 21:42:48	+brookz	think this was like 2009
2018-10-02 21:43:59	+brookz	https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-the-linux-mint-hack-is-an-indicator-of-a-larger-problem/
2018-10-02 21:44:12	+brookz	I don't remember offhand, my memory of it is hazy
2018-10-02 21:46:35	+brookz	>Linux Mint, when considered as the sum of its parts, is the Cinnamon desktop environment (DE), mintTools (software installer, update manager, backup too, welcome screen, etc.) and GNOME extensions built on top of an LTS version of Ubuntu. The repositories contain packages compiled for Ubuntu, without modification or recompilation. As outlined above, security patches and updates that work
2018-10-02 21:46:37	+brookz	perfectly in Debian and Ubuntu are blacklisted as needed to not break under Mint—the only differentiation Mint provides is Cinnamon, thereby breaking security so that it "just works."
2018-10-02 21:47:05	+brookz	>The task of maintaining and securing it is not a trivial task, and it requires more infrastructure and resources than the Linux Mint team possesses. Creating a pseudo-fork of an existing distribution to showcase a DE, while blacklisting updates—some of which are security updates—because it interferes with the DE is staggeringly irresponsible and tantamount to security malpractice.
2018-10-02 21:47:16	+winny	wow that article is terrible
2018-10-02 21:47:31	+winny	i guess it's the nature of news writing
2018-10-02 21:47:37	+winny	good points tho
2018-10-02 21:47:37	+brookz	yeah
2018-10-02 21:48:01	+winny	in particular how it hooks readers about a attack on the website
2018-10-02 21:48:14	+winny	but then goes on to push a different agenda not related to the hack
2018-10-02 21:48:43	+naught0	https://i.imgur.com/aBKjDmC.png >:)
2018-10-02 21:49:01	+brookz	huh
2018-10-02 21:49:12	+brookz	the title of it is "why the linux mint hack is an indicator of a larger problem" though
2018-10-02 21:49:29	+brookz	naught0: nice
2018-10-02 21:49:34	+naught0	:D
2018-10-02 21:49:43	+winny	naught0: what os is that
2018-10-02 21:49:55	+brookz	I like your bar thingy
2018-10-02 21:49:58	+brookz	too
2018-10-02 21:50:05	+naught0	c'est arch linux !
2018-10-02 21:50:07	+naught0	oh thank you
2018-10-02 21:50:08	+brookz	how do you have such precise signal quality percentage
2018-10-02 21:50:12	+winny	oh rather
2018-10-02 21:50:18	+winny	what DE/wm/bar are you using
2018-10-02 21:50:26	+naught0	none/herbstluftwm/lemonbar
2018-10-02 21:50:29	+naught0	brookz: sec
2018-10-02 21:50:54	+brookz	how does herbslutwm compare to bspwm
2018-10-02 21:50:56	+naught0	http://sprunge.us/CL0BYC
2018-10-02 21:50:59	+naught0	I actually came from bspwm
2018-10-02 21:51:06	+naught0	I enjoy herbstluftwm's manual tiling more I'd say
2018-10-02 21:51:09	+naught0	and it feels easier to script
2018-10-02 21:51:46	+brookz	interesting
2018-10-02 21:51:55	+brookz	how is the tiling different?
2018-10-02 21:52:43	+winny	this is my current desktop rn https://ptpb.pw/vFcu.png
2018-10-02 21:52:52	+naught0	it's actually manual !
2018-10-02 21:53:01	+naught0	like you create the tiles and move stuff around
2018-10-02 21:53:10	+brookz	tfw everyone's desktop is cooler than mine
2018-10-02 21:53:13	+winny	so more like ratpoison?
2018-10-02 21:53:17	+naught0	I think so yeah
2018-10-02 21:54:22	+winny	brookz: what's your desktop lol
2018-10-02 21:54:35	+brookz	openbox+tint2
2018-10-02 21:54:55	+brookz	probably going on 10 years soon
2018-10-02 21:55:21	+brookz	I don't like tiling much
2018-10-02 21:55:51	+brookz	and it's the only light/good/configurable floating wm I'm aware of
2018-10-02 21:55:57	+winny	nice
2018-10-02 21:56:01	+winny	screenshot
2018-10-02 21:56:03	+winny	:33
2018-10-02 21:56:42	+brookz	n-not much to see
2018-10-02 21:58:10	+brookz	sec
2018-10-02 21:58:29	+brookz	https://a.uguu.se/CPokjADuHwUC.png
2018-10-02 21:59:59	+winny	nice n simple
2018-10-02 22:00:08	+brookz	it's pretty much always like this
2018-10-02 22:01:03	+kori	ur all plebs
2018-10-02 22:02:19	+brookz	fight me
2018-10-02 22:02:32	+kori	https://a.uguu.se/FT7RMNFr2iDV_lol.png theres some artifacts so excuse that
2018-10-02 22:03:23	+brookz	this is impossible to see at my lowest brightness setting / 10
2018-10-02 22:03:44	+kori	literally GOML
2018-10-02 22:03:55	+brookz	GOML?
2018-10-02 22:04:01	+kori	>not using max brightness at all times
2018-10-02 22:04:12	+brookz	>not using min brightness at all times
2018-10-02 22:04:22	+kori	get on my level
2018-10-02 22:04:36	+brookz	nerd
2018-10-02 22:05:00	+gnu	ye
2018-10-02 22:05:05	+brookz	I just realized, I could use httpserver.py again
2018-10-02 22:05:08	+gnu	i'm on min brightness all the time lol
2018-10-02 22:05:11	+gnu	with redshift
2018-10-02 22:05:13	+kori	no u
2018-10-02 22:05:17	+gnu	redshift's location thing broke recently though
2018-10-02 22:05:19	+brookz	I just need an ssh tunnel
2018-10-02 22:05:21	+kori	i use redshift
2018-10-02 22:05:24	+LambdaComplex	48-pack of beer: Obtained
2018-10-02 22:05:29	+brookz	nice
2018-10-02 22:05:33	+gnu	damn that's like $100 LambdaComplex 
2018-10-02 22:05:34	+kori	dicks: Out
2018-10-02 22:05:45	+kori	tbh idg why redshift must use locations why cant it just use timezones
2018-10-02 22:05:46	+LambdaComplex	gnu: what
2018-10-02 22:05:47	+gnu	r they all for u?
2018-10-02 22:05:53	+LambdaComplex	it was like $24
2018-10-02 22:06:02	+gnu	that's smart kori 
2018-10-02 22:06:08	+gnu	you should submit a PR with that
2018-10-02 22:06:15	+gnu	maybe location is more accurate though
2018-10-02 22:06:25	+LambdaComplex	maybe they're using some geo library that doesn't use timezones
2018-10-02 22:06:30	+gnu	could be up to like a 30 minute difference in sunsets
2018-10-02 22:06:31	+LambdaComplex	maybe REWRITE IT IN RUST OR GO OR JAVA OR SOMETHING
2018-10-02 22:06:37	+LambdaComplex	also what gnu is saying
2018-10-02 22:06:43	+LambdaComplex	also isn't china a single timezone now?
2018-10-02 22:06:48	+LambdaComplex	bet it's more than 30 minute diff there
2018-10-02 22:07:30	+gnu	it's actually pretty significant
2018-10-02 22:07:32	+gnu	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/US-Timezones.svg/1200px-US-Timezones.svg.png
2018-10-02 22:07:35	+brookz	kori: same, I don't want redshift accessing the internet and that's 99% of the reason I don't use it
2018-10-02 22:07:36	+gnu	[W|A] sunset | Chicago, Illinois, United States | today = 6:30 pm CDT 
2018-10-02 22:07:40	+brookz	I'm just gonna get cancer rip
2018-10-02 22:07:42	+gnu	[W|A] sunset | Dallas, Texas, United States | today = 7:10 pm CDT
2018-10-02 22:07:44	+gnu	40 mins
2018-10-02 22:08:06	+LambdaComplex	brookz: rewrite redshift in rust and leave out the location detection shit and make it just use a config file
2018-10-02 22:08:12	+brookz	tempting
2018-10-02 22:08:14	+LambdaComplex	and then get cancer anyways
2018-10-02 22:08:21	+LambdaComplex	....i kinda wanna try that
2018-10-02 22:08:21	+gnu	redshift can do that
2018-10-02 22:08:25	+LambdaComplex	how tf does redshift even work
2018-10-02 22:08:28	+LambdaComplex	gnu: missing the point
2018-10-02 22:08:29	+gnu	that's what i ended up having to do
2018-10-02 22:08:33	+gnu	write a config file
2018-10-02 22:08:35	+gnu	:(
2018-10-02 22:08:55	+LambdaComplex	yes but you're still running a binary that you haven't audited that has the ability to tell some server on the internet what your lat and long are
2018-10-02 22:09:07	+LambdaComplex	that is The Problem
2018-10-02 22:10:41	+brookz	redshift is the FOSS one
2018-10-02 22:11:07	+LambdaComplex	brookz: yes, i know. but has gnu gone through the source code?
2018-10-02 22:11:18	+brookz	dunno
2018-10-02 22:11:20	+brookz	doubt it
2018-10-02 22:11:24	+LambdaComplex	there's my point
2018-10-02 22:11:27	+LambdaComplex	:D
2018-10-02 22:11:36	+brookz	I do agree
2018-10-02 22:11:46	+brookz	why does everything on my system think it can just access the internet without my consent
2018-10-02 22:11:48	+brookz	idgi
2018-10-02 22:12:12	+brookz	take me back
2018-10-02 22:12:23	+LambdaComplex	brookz: you need a hardware firewall tbqh
2018-10-02 22:12:54	+trinary	bwrap or qemu will do too
2018-10-02 22:13:29	+LambdaComplex	INSTALL OPENBSD
2018-10-02 22:13:31	+LambdaComplex	RUN PF
2018-10-02 22:13:34	+LambdaComplex	INSTALL PFSENSE
2018-10-02 22:13:38	+LambdaComplex	RUN....FREEBSD PF
2018-10-02 22:13:41	+LambdaComplex	INSTALL FREEBSD
2018-10-02 22:13:43	+LambdaComplex	RUN IPFW I GUESS?
2018-10-02 22:13:47	+LambdaComplex	GET A CISCO ASA
2018-10-02 22:13:52	+LambdaComplex	LEARN HOW TO CONFIGURE THAT
2018-10-02 22:13:57	+trinary	(Although letting a VM control the hosts display... would be a curious decision)
2018-10-02 22:14:04	+LambdaComplex	(why is ASA syntax different from IOS? please explain.)
2018-10-02 22:17:29	+lvmbdv	I'm trying opebsd for daily use on a laptop 
2018-10-02 22:17:48	+brookz	I want a hardware firewall, but what I want more is a world where I don't need one ;_;
2018-10-02 22:17:48	+lvmbdv	it's not terrible 
2018-10-02 22:18:05	+lvmbdv	I want a gun that can shoot people through the internet
2018-10-02 22:19:04	+LambdaComplex	lvmbdv: how is openbsd treating you
2018-10-02 22:19:08	+LambdaComplex	i'm using it as a router/gateway thing
2018-10-02 22:19:47	+lvmbdv	only a couple of bumps 
2018-10-02 22:20:28	+lvmbdv	it seems fine but void linux was definitely faster on the oldish laptop I'm trying it on
2018-10-02 22:21:07	+lvmbdv	buuut it wasn't full encrypted, I set up openbsd with FDE from the start
2018-10-02 22:21:14	+lvmbdv	which was surprisingly easy 
2018-10-02 22:21:31	+brookz	void with encryption is also pretty easy
2018-10-02 22:21:38	+lvmbdv	yeah I'm sure
2018-10-02 22:21:41	+brookz	there's a guide on the wiki
2018-10-02 22:21:51	+brookz	but I'm sure openbsd is more appealing
2018-10-02 22:21:54	+brookz	not sarcasm
2018-10-02 22:22:00	+lvmbdv	I just didn't bother, I use the machine for on-site CTFs
2018-10-02 22:22:32	+lvmbdv	and other events I dare not bring something I can't afford to replace 
2018-10-02 22:23:40	+brookz	actually pretty cool
